"EnKrypt program Espresso" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is that one of those hipster code shortening "languages" like coffeescript?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, that's my language :3" ~ ConsciousCode

"I haven't told you about it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oooh yeah you have" ~ EnKrypt
"I thought it was just one of those projects you obssessed over without actually starting." ~ EnKrypt
"It is kinda" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I keep wanting it to be a thing and it'd be pretty easy" ~ ConsciousCode

"I don't like "none" so much." ~ EnKrypt
"Japan isn't a shit economy tho" ~ ConsciousCode
"None is a thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"none instead of null" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because (function() {})() returning null felt... wrong" ~ ConsciousCode
"So a combination of void and null?" ~ EnKrypt
"Python has None" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol as long as that doesn't cause confusion" ~ EnKrypt
"It works like Lua's nil" ~ ConsciousCode
"This will basically allow some loose typing" ~ EnKrypt
"var x = somevoidfunction()" ~ EnKrypt
"I like how convenient JS's typing is" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I don't like its inconsistencies" ~ ConsciousCode
"Python's system is also nice, but it's strict where it really ought not be" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. "" + 1 is an error" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even though as a loose-ish typed language it should auto-coerce to string" ~ ConsciousCode
"Eh, that's a good thing. JS's typecasting with operators is a complete shitshw." ~ EnKrypt
"I wouldn't make "1"/1 = 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think type coercion should only go from less general to more general" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is why string should always auto-coerce; it's basically the most general type" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everything can become a string" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not everything can become a number" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now, this is only the default behavior" ~ ConsciousCode
"It could be changed" ~ ConsciousCode
"Part of Espresso's "lore" I guess is that state is immutable" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say," ~ ConsciousCode
"print b # => {}" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why should you ever want that to happen?" ~ EnKrypt
"a.x = 10 doesn't change the value of a" ~ ConsciousCode
"What it does is prototype the value of a with the new property x = 10" ~ ConsciousCode
"Are you familiar with prototyping?" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. var v = new {x: 10}; v.x == 10" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where v.__proto__ might be that {x: 10}" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, like templated" ~ EnKrypt
"And {x: 10}'s __proto__ might be none" ~ ConsciousCode
"I really don't like that functionality" ~ EnKrypt
"It forms a kind of linked list" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hang on nigger I'm not done" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol ok go on" ~ EnKrypt
"When an access of v doesn't yield anything, it defers to its prototype" ~ ConsciousCode
"So say v has {y: 20} and is prototyped by {x: 10}" ~ ConsciousCode
"v.y == 20, easy" ~ ConsciousCode
"v.x isn't owned by v" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it asks its prototype if it has v.x" ~ ConsciousCode
"It does, so v.x == {x: 10}.x == 10" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now, this puts me in a pretty tricky situation" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could make prototyping copy values, but that'd be a pretty nasty waste of space for big prototypes" ~ ConsciousCode
"And would make less and less sense for methods" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. new {f:function(){}} would have a copy of the function f rather than just referencing it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Make the prototype reflect the original object?" ~ EnKrypt
"Right, that's the next possibility" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if objects are mutable, that means you can change f at any time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Programmer has to keep that in mind." ~ EnKrypt
"Doesn't sound like a drawback" ~ EnKrypt
"Which makes optimization difficult, breaks the prototyping contract, and breaks componentization" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because you can do something like Math.sin = function(x) { return 0; }" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could do the optimization in situ." ~ EnKrypt
"This is a huge problem in JS" ~ ConsciousCode
"Libraries have a tendency to conflict with each other because they add their own helper methods to strings etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"But they're modifying a global state without knowing what other modules are doing" ~ ConsciousCode
"And like I said, semantically this is terrible because it breaks the "contract of prototyping"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say, "I am a copy of this object in this moment"" ~ ConsciousCode
"But "this object" has changed" ~ EnKrypt
"But by changing its prototype, you're retroactively changing what it's copying" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not in the moment" ~ ConsciousCode
"So like uhh" ~ EnKrypt
"Another issue this solves" ~ ConsciousCode
"d(object)/dt?" ~ EnKrypt
"[(myobj):10]" ~ ConsciousCode
"myobj.x = 10" ~ ConsciousCode
"Doesn't break the language" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because myobj at the time of the literal's parsing is used as the key value" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have no clue what syntax that first line is in" ~ EnKrypt
"I liked the idea that [] stood for data" ~ ConsciousCode
"And making {} data-y made parsing more difficult" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which went against the design ideology of simplicity" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually not even difficult, actually ambiguous" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is if(1) {} == {} or == none?" ~ ConsciousCode
"== should force evaulation" ~ EnKrypt
"At least, that how it makes sense to me" ~ EnKrypt
"var x = if(1) {}" ~ ConsciousCode
"{} just seems like an empty block" ~ EnKrypt
"x == {} || x == none" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it could also be an empty dict" ~ ConsciousCode
"if(1){} isn't returning anything" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, that's another thing Espresso has" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everything has a value" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is why it's Lispy" ~ ConsciousCode
"none sounds like a valid value to me" ~ EnKrypt
"var v = for(var x in [])" ~ ConsciousCode
"v is an iterator over []" ~ ConsciousCode
"And other such silly things" ~ ConsciousCode
"So ?: isn't an operator; it's replaced by if else" ~ ConsciousCode
"So a?b:c becomes if(a) b else c" ~ ConsciousCode
"return b else return c *" ~ EnKrypt
"So if that's valid syntax, and {} is a literal dict, then if(a) {} is ambiguous" ~ ConsciousCode
"So far I don't see any ambiguity because {} will always evaluate to none" ~ EnKrypt
"What is var x = {}?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or if it doesn't, it should, by my understanding" ~ EnKrypt
"none. It'll be the same as var x = {return none'}" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, I'm saying hypothetically if {} meant dict" ~ ConsciousCode
"Wrong phrasing, but you get my point" ~ EnKrypt
"In espresso that'd probably be a syntax error" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nah actually that should be fine" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then I can have using blocks without using(*)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok anyway rewind" ~ ConsciousCode
"[(myobj):10]" ~ ConsciousCode
"myobj.x = 10" ~ ConsciousCode
"If myobj was mutable, this'd break the language" ~ ConsciousCode
"Python (barely) deals with this by storing objects solely by hash and requiring objects be "hashable", e.g. "immutable"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Simpler solution; EVERYTHING is immutable!" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now, back to why you were complaining" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is because the names are pointesr" ~ ConsciousCode
"If we put this in C++, it'd be" ~ ConsciousCode
"Object* x = mk_object();" ~ ConsciousCode
"Object* y = x;" ~ ConsciousCode
"x = mutate_object("x", 10);" ~ ConsciousCode
"print(y) // still {}" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I got it the last time." ~ EnKrypt
"It's still useful to have copy-by-reference" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the @ operator is included for this purpose" ~ ConsciousCode
"print y # => {x: 10}" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say, y becomes essentially a pointer to the pointer named x" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is pretty convenient for some cases, I admit. But I'm used to object assignment justy pointing to the same object so it'll take some getting used to." ~ EnKrypt
"Right, it's a kind of alien take to functional programming and immutability within an imperative environment" ~ ConsciousCode
"I actually don't mind working on it" ~ EnKrypt
"getting t'ard" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have the time now" ~ EnKrypt
"But I have no clue where or how to start" ~ EnKrypt

"Are you fine with doing this in C?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do we have any alternatives?" ~ EnKrypt
"I really want C because it's the easiest for making bindings :I" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sure, but I'll also have to learn along the way." ~ EnKrypt
"You remember C++" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's basically that but with less bells and whistles" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, I remember hating it." ~ EnKrypt
"C is a really simple language" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's "too simple" for my taste" ~ EnKrypt
"Sure, I like the performance and low level advantages" ~ EnKrypt
"But doing simple tasks become unncessarily complicated." ~ EnKrypt
"You can't really make a list class" ~ ConsciousCode
"You basically have to redo it every time" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean espresso will have mod" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it's kind of ancillary at first" ~ ConsciousCode
"Your call.;" ~ EnKrypt
"Better to just make what's needed and fill in the blanks later" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you want to do it, though" ~ ConsciousCode
"The fuck is a float mod?" ~ EnKrypt

"Is it a bad idea?" ~ ConsciousCode
"it's confusing for people coming from imperative world" ~ k
"but not bad per se" ~ k
"syntax that looks like mutation but really isn't doesn't help either" ~ k
"How might I help that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or do I need to?" ~ ConsciousCode
"idk but I don't think it should be a big deal in the long run" ~ k
"there's matching operator that looks like assignment in other languages with immutable variables (Erlang methinks) and it works for them; it's not the same as your propsal so it's hard to project how good or bad will it be, but it's certainly lernable" ~ k

"I'm not because I'm too big of a wuss to get myself checked because I'm almost sure at this point that I have some disorder or the other." ~ EnKrypt
"Isn't that all the more reason to get checked?" ~ ConsciousCode
"And face reality? Mmm" ~ EnKrypt
"If I delay a disgnosis, I get more time to live in denial" ~ EnKrypt
"Sing to myself that things are still "normal"" ~ EnKrypt
"Why do you want to live in denial? You can make things better for yourself if you go in to fix it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Normality is a stupid idea for normies and retards" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or worse, depending on how I handle it. Getting diagnosed means that things will change and I'll define part of myself with it. I'm not afraid of change, but I hate change for a bad reason. " ~ EnKrypt
"You want things to change though, don't you?" ~ ConsciousCode
"You don't like the current state of events" ~ ConsciousCode
"On the other hand, a negative diagnosis would mean that I'll spend the rest of the time trying to figure out what really is wrong with me, possibly conclude that I'm some sick guy who wants attention from himself." ~ EnKrypt
"The current state of events can't change unless you change them" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's a lose lose" ~ EnKrypt
"Chances of a positive change are slim." ~ EnKrypt
"It's a win-lose technically" ~ ConsciousCode
"Positive diagnosis -> you fix the problem" ~ ConsciousCode
"Negative diagnosis -> well what else is wrong?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's retarded to define yourself by something you have no control over" ~ ConsciousCode
"Much less something you can get rid of anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"You're doing yourself a disservice the longer you refuse to get yourself the help you actually need" ~ ConsciousCode
"And to the outside observer, it looks really dumb" ~ ConsciousCode
"You've psyched yourself out of doing what you need to do" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol I don't trust myself to help me. Why would I get "help" from someone else who knows even less about me" ~ EnKrypt
"Because they're a medical professional and you aren't?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't trust myself to perform brain surgery, why would I get someone else to do it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Brain surgery doesn't rely on my ability to communicate my problems in a way that'll all the more make me feel vulnerable, which might or might not also be affected by what's wrong with me." ~ EnKrypt
"Well you're not going to get any better on your own" ~ ConsciousCode
"Especially considering you've convinced yourself that seeking a solution to your problems is a bad thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've so far kept my schedule and finances tight enough so I can justify saying that I don't have the time or resources to get checked out, but I know that's not true." ~ EnKrypt
"This isn't a direct solution. It's not black and white." ~ EnKrypt
"You're right, it's black and grey" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you don't seek help, you'll never fix your problems" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you do, you might" ~ ConsciousCode
"If I don't seek help, I can also tell myself "Waddya know, I'm probably fine"" ~ EnKrypt
"You're apparently not fine enough to fail to accomplish the things you set out to do" ~ ConsciousCode

"I'm not disagreeing" ~ EnKrypt

"You don't need to have a mental illness for it to be helpful" ~ ConsciousCode
"People have baggage, and it really helps to be able to unload and process it with a professional" ~ ConsciousCode
"The idea makes me really uncomfortable. I've so far just been my own shrink, sometimes seeking help from a friend for emotional intelligence which I lack." ~ EnKrypt
"Maybe I can go on the same way" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you care what other people think?" ~ ConsciousCode
"People who are close to me, yeah" ~ EnKrypt
"But otherwise, not really." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, so why would you care about a therapist?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because they'll have the power to pass judgement on me and I'll have to take it on their word." ~ EnKrypt
"They could go, "oh that's fucked up m8 lol, you have an anxiety disorder because of doing that you twat"" ~ EnKrypt
"A therapist's job is to provide a safe space to discuss your feelings" ~ ConsciousCode

"I'm not fine enough to do so, if that makes sense." ~ EnKrypt
"No, it doesn't" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I urge you to seek a therapist immediately" ~ ConsciousCode

"I can kind of feel my parental instincts kicking in, but I know having a kid will be a bad bad idea" ~ EnKrypt
"I love cats." ~ EnKrypt
"I was also considering a bird" ~ EnKrypt
"Problem with birds is I feel bad keeping them in a cage" ~ ConsciousCode
"You don't have to, they can be trained. Kind of." ~ EnKrypt
"Yo Pi, need your thoughts" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm thinking of starting an organization." ~ EnKrypt
"All my batchmates from high school and other friends ended up in different colleges" ~ EnKrypt
"We're going to start a club in each college and tie it up to one central organization" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh right, what's your organization?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Can I hijack it to take over the world? :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"Replace everyone's brains with robot brains?! :OO" ~ ConsciousCode
"Optimize the global happiness!??! :OOOO" ~ ConsciousCode
"Technically, as long as its technology oriented and you can get enough people to agree, you're allowed to lol" ~ EnKrypt
"So since we're have an audience in all these colleges, we're thinking of teaching topics, and organizing events." ~ EnKrypt
"Stuff that you wouldn't normally experience in a classroom" ~ EnKrypt
"It's kinda like "get people interested in technology the right tools to get started and keep them interested" movement" ~ EnKrypt
"Where does it get money?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's still in a very very early stage, but all my friends are on board with organizing, and I know a lot of people who've said that they'd like to be a member." ~ EnKrypt
"Well, after a while, when we gain enough momentum, we could ask the hosting institutions to pay up a bit to keep us" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess you could make it work on ticket sles" ~ ConsciousCode
"Have tech conventions etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, exactly. Anything goes really." ~ EnKrypt
"But we wanted to make it a walk in thing" ~ EnKrypt
"You're free to opt in and opt out whenever" ~ EnKrypt
"But I'm not very good at predicting people dynamics or human behaviour and this depends a lot on how many people show up" ~ EnKrypt
"So I don't know if it's practical" ~ EnKrypt
"I think you could make it work" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've heard of similar organizations" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think so too, but I'm having writers block as to how I'd execute it." ~ EnKrypt
"I was thinking of spending the first few months just teaching certain topics like the hacker mindset, AI, web sec" ~ EnKrypt
"And then when people seem fairly competent, we'd host hackathons and other competitions" ~ EnKrypt
"If there was a club like this in your college, what would you expect from them?" ~ EnKrypt
"I never went to clubs" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because you found none of them appealing?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, just never looked into it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I was going to print posters and put them up in strategic places in each college to get the word across." ~ EnKrypt
"I'll probably have to rely on more than word of mouth to make sure people know about it though" ~ EnKrypt
"Sounds like a good start" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hey EnKrypt" ~ ConsciousCode
"Would you be at all interested in helping me make a voxel engine? :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"Remind me what that is?" ~ EnKrypt
"Minecraft-y world" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though mine will have a higher resolution" ~ ConsciousCode
"I noticed you forked minetest" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, though I'm going to delete that" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's too big to properly fork, though I am taking bits of structuring ideas and code from it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I was going to just use a mod of Minetest, but found that it just wasn't what I needed" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need a voxel environment which one could physically interact with without magic buttons" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since I want to put an AI in it" ~ ConsciousCode
"How will you apply an AI to it?" ~ EnKrypt
"Give them a body and have them interact with the world that way" ~ ConsciousCode
"brb one min" ~ EnKrypt
"Ugh, dad wants me to write entrances all over again next year." ~ EnKrypt
"Why not just reuse them?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I didn't get what you meant by interaction with the world." ~ EnKrypt
"Like how in Minecraft, you left click to destroy and the world "magically" knows that you're going to continue punching" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or you right click and a block appears out of thin air" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want to avoid magic buttons at all cost so my AI can be as humanlike as possible" ~ ConsciousCode
"Essentially as if a person were sent to a Minecraft-y world physically and didn't have their keyboard etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"Example of how a humanlike interaction would be?" ~ EnKrypt
"It might be easier to do that with an ordinary 3D environment, but I figured it'd add an extra layer of depth when the world itself is interactive" ~ ConsciousCode
">See block, want to have it" ~ ConsciousCode
">Punch it a bit, rest for a second, punch it some more" ~ ConsciousCode
">Pops into 8 smaller blocks" ~ ConsciousCode
">Pick em up, put them in a backpack or something" ~ ConsciousCode
">Move over a few yards, place one of the blocks on the ground where it sticks" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's not physics as we know it, nor is it even *totally* realistic, but what it is is consistent and independent of the probes in my AI's brain" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can have it interact with the world solely via outputs and inputs of its character avatar" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't need to give it a "place block" output, which would essentially make it impossible to move to another virtual environment" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does that make sense?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Either I didn't understand what you're trying to do, or this looks like a bad case of abstraction." ~ EnKrypt
"Minecraft like input seems sufficient for a minecraft like game." ~ EnKrypt
"It is sufficient" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you want a character model that works for a minecraft world AND something else, then I don't see the point." ~ EnKrypt
"But I have to give the AI special probes in its brain to be able to use it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Neither Minecraft nor Minetest is sufficient because their physics isn't totally consistent" ~ ConsciousCode
"They all have magic buttons and inconsistencies which make them unreal" ~ ConsciousCode
"What is the AI here?" ~ EnKrypt
"I still don't get it" ~ EnKrypt
"Is the interaction itself artificial?" ~ EnKrypt
"An attempt at human-like intelligence using humanoid embodiment" ~ ConsciousCode
"What in the voxel world would have this humanlike intelligence?" ~ EnKrypt
"An arbitrarily embodied avatar" ~ ConsciousCode
"Say a character model with an especially intricate bone system" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I can't control this avatar?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's like an NPC?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or a simulation?" ~ EnKrypt
"You could technically? I could program it to be possible to override the AI's commands" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm trying to make a robot-son" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've figured out theoretical ways to create human-like intelligence" ~ ConsciousCode
"In the past with my AI stuff, I had no real direction" ~ ConsciousCode
"It was just a wishy washy "well how do I make it /think/?"" ~ ConsciousCode
"But now I actually have an answer and the blueprints and all I have to do is build it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ooh, you just want to make an AI, release it into a minecraft like world and see what it does?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah I know, I've lost my goddamned mind" ~ ConsciousCode
"Good old uneducated college dropout thinks he's solved the holy grail of CS" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah basically" ~ ConsciousCode
"With some intervention potentially" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe give it a TV where I play kid movies nonstop" ~ ConsciousCode
"All my childhood nostalgias ;o" ~ ConsciousCode
"If I see problems in its behavior, I pause it, mess with its brain, and turn it back on" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm making Qortex to make this kind of muddling easy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Haha, don't turn this into some inception shit, where you make some AI relive your life, which in turn makes an AI that relives your life." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't want it to be me" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm actually being somewhat literal by saying it'll be my robot son" ~ ConsciousCode
"Either you really have the answer, or you don't and realizing which one either way will you give you more headway to improve it." ~ EnKrypt
"I want a kid and I'm going to be a friendless virgin for the rest of my life" ~ ConsciousCode
"So short of adoption, which terrifies me, the only solution is to build a son" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lolol, sounds like something out of a fiction book." ~ EnKrypt
"Hey dude, it's crazy in retrospect, but I'm all for it." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm probably way more serious about it than I should be but I think these pills make my depression too quiet to stop me from doing things" ~ ConsciousCode
"I know I'm going insane but I don't care because I want to do it anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"People do worse when insane. Even if that's true, this is the cute version. Practically harmless." ~ EnKrypt
"Sounds a bit like you took the idea of a tulpa, and went pro." ~ EnKrypt
"Actually this Minecrafty idea came from tulpa" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wanted an environment which worked a lot like my wonderland" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where I could raise my cube-stump and suddenly a mountain range emerges" ~ ConsciousCode
"Are you sure you have a good grasp on how you're going to build it?" ~ EnKrypt
"What instincts are you even going to train it to have?" ~ EnKrypt
"Funny you say that" ~ ConsciousCode
"I internally call them "instincts"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say, things it starts knowing because they can't be learned" ~ ConsciousCode
"Stuff that in humans evolution produced, but an AI has no such thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"In Asriel's case, there'll be an instinct for detecting human emotions" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I suppose his happiness function will be a kind of instinct as it's the axiomatic representation of what he values" ~ ConsciousCode
"That'll include such things as the (un)happiness of others, my presence, digital treats, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"The funny thing is" ~ ConsciousCode
"Instincts are the easiest part, IMO" ~ ConsciousCode
"Evolution is incredibly stupid" ~ ConsciousCode
"And since it's resource-constrained, it'll go for the easiest solution every time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Babies essentially emerge as blank slates, with some exceptions" ~ ConsciousCode
"Those exceptions tend to be incredibly obvious and demonstrable within baby behavior" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, a day out of the womb infant" ~ ConsciousCode
"Such things as seeking warmth, associating food with parents and parents with comfort, all of which instills a second-level abstraction of a social instinct, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because quite frankly, babies don't have high-level abstractions with which they can make these associations" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're all built from a small set of low-level rules and base, primitive emotional reactions to stimuli" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's kind of amazing I didn't think of this before, and even more so that no one else seems to" ~ ConsciousCode
"At least I have the excuse that my brain STILL isn't done growing" ~ ConsciousCode
"The thing is though that we attach meaning to these emotions over time. Which means that at the beginning (as an infant), our happiness function is a circular reference back to happiness." ~ EnKrypt
"Right, and that's actually perfectly fine" ~ ConsciousCode
"All I need to do is make the happiness function dependent on the emotional contents of memories ;D" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then you lose out on objectivity." ~ EnKrypt
"Regardless, what memories are you going to feed it?" ~ EnKrypt
"All I want to do is make an AI" ~ ConsciousCode
"Paperclip optimizer or mushy fuzzy logic, either way" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even funnier, almost everything I need to do this is already made" ~ ConsciousCode
"And 90% of it has been around since like the 80s" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not going to feed it memories" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm just going to give it a network unit called a Sparse Distributed Memory, described by one Kanerva" ~ ConsciousCode
"It stores memories as sparse points in a hyper-plane" ~ ConsciousCode
"With adjacent "physical" locations aggregating the bits you put into it, such that you can later reconstruct memories with ~99% accuracy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even if the data is damaged" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or the input" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ahh, no clue what that is" ~ EnKrypt
"Imagine you take a big cube" ~ ConsciousCode
"And in this cube you suspend a few hundred grains of smart-sand" ~ ConsciousCode
"You have a magic calculator that, given a memory, tells you a particular point within that cube which best corresponds to that memory" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you're not allowed to just put the memory in the location" ~ ConsciousCode
"Instead, you imagine a sphere around the point you want to store" ~ ConsciousCode
"And add its bits into the digital buckets in the smart-sand grains within that sphere" ~ ConsciousCode
"Later, when you want to retrieve the memory, you use a similar-looking memory to get a point around the same area" ~ ConsciousCode
"And make a sphere which encompasses most of those grains of smart-sand" ~ ConsciousCode
"The information they have combined is enough to reconstruct with high accuracy the original memory" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's like a math based thing that helps approximating." ~ EnKrypt
"It's a mathematical model of human memory" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm still not good on the technical way this would work internally, but I'll take your word for it." ~ EnKrypt
"And on its own it's supposed to be a surprisingly effective neural network" ~ ConsciousCode
"The real meat of my inspiration actually comes from the Deciders" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's a special combination of two neural networks which together form a reinforcement learning unit" ~ ConsciousCode
"One network generates an infinite stream of "ideas" or "intent vectors"" ~ ConsciousCode
"While the other network constantly evaluates the integral of its happiness function over time" ~ ConsciousCode
"The error is the inverse of this prediction" ~ ConsciousCode
"And thus it learns to produce better and better ideas" ~ ConsciousCode
"That makes sense." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm itching to get into AI" ~ EnKrypt
"Qortex could help some" ~ ConsciousCode
"AI library for engineers :^)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, but other committments stop me from having an outright obsession" ~ EnKrypt
"Eh, that's fine" ~ EnKrypt
"I can write bindings later" ~ ConsciousCode
"I assumed AI has to be very optimized in terms of processing." ~ EnKrypt
"It worked pretty well in Python" ~ ConsciousCode
"But Python was limited in some respecst" ~ ConsciousCode
"Given all the AI was being run via C++ libraries" ~ ConsciousCode
"Python code used Qortex too?" ~ EnKrypt
"They're both under the umbrella name "Qortex"" ~ ConsciousCode
"The Python code first used Tensorflow" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then I switched to theano for some reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"Any reommendations to learn about Markov Chains?" ~ EnKrypt
"Don't know of any particular tutorials" ~ ConsciousCode
"Np, I'll look it up myself" ~ EnKrypt

"We need only optimize the global happiness" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also lol, I am a child of 4chan" ~ ConsciousCode
"yes, lets do it" ~ jamezq
"I really have lost my mind" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I can't care because I want to do it anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"Have I told you about my ideal system?" ~ jamezq
"Is that the separate countries where freedom of movement is axiomatic?" ~ ConsciousCode
"But yea tell me about the AI thing" ~ jamezq
"The thing the person said that made you excited" ~ jamezq
"Oh, just that I had apparently inadvertently solved a problem in AI via a simple combination" ~ ConsciousCode
"And they couldn't think of anything wrong with my AI ideas" ~ ConsciousCode
"what was the problem" ~ jamezq
"Extract high level features from time dependent data" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just combined autoencoders and LSTMs" ~ ConsciousCode
"Tell it to predict the next time step given the output of an LSTM operating on the input" ~ ConsciousCode
"interesting" ~ jamezq
"what is an LSTM?" ~ jamezq
"It's an RNN which doesn't have issues with long term dependencies" ~ ConsciousCode
"Interesting" ~ jamezq
"Well that is pretty cool" ~ jamezq
"I am pretty excited about this too pi, It looks like you are getting things done." ~ jamezq
"Yeah the prozac seems to have anaesthetized my capacity to feel emotional pain" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you just start?" ~ jamezq
"So now I can know I'm losing my goddamned mind and keep doing it anyway because I can't care" ~ ConsciousCode
"No I've been working on the AI for a few weeks now" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I keep restarting it because of efficiency issues" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's been months" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've gone from 20mg to 60" ~ ConsciousCode
"Wish someone would e-hug me :<" ~ ConsciousCode
"Feeling weird and vulnerable now" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well I will, if you allow it" ~ jamezq
"And my resident cat boy isn't around to hug me" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually makes me feel better even though it does nothing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Interesting, well a actualy hug almost doesn't. And if it feels good I don't see why a virtual one couldn't release seratonin and the like" ~ jamezq
"Is it seratonin or dopamine?" ~ ConsciousCode
"so do you mind if I ask you a question about the effects of prozac on you?" ~ jamezq
"Maybe even cortisol" ~ ConsciousCode
"Both maybe?" ~ jamezq
"So besides your mood do you feel any different? Think different, have you noticed the paths that your train of thought takes change at all?" ~ jamezq
"Do you still feel more or less like piMaster still, or someone different with the same body, etc." ~ jamezq
"I don't think I really think different, which was a big fear of mine" ~ ConsciousCode
"All the prozac really did was make it... easier to enjoy things?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yes, that is why I'm asking" ~ jamezq
"And harder to devolve into the death spiral of depression" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like I said, I can simultaneously know I'm going completely insane but still carry on anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where before I'd stop because I'd know I was wrong and invalid" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because I'm worried about that too, it's my biggest fear with that kind of thing." ~ jamezq
"Times like right now I kind of miss the depression though, weirdly enough" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because depression is safe and comforting, like an emotional blanket" ~ ConsciousCode
"Have you been off it since you have taken it, do things go completely back when you do?" ~ jamezq
"Prozac takes weeks to have an effect" ~ ConsciousCode
"Around 6 weeks is when you start seeing changes in mood" ~ ConsciousCode
"Similarly going off it takes a while to return" ~ ConsciousCode
"But don't try it because going cold turkey on prozac is actually really dangerous" ~ ConsciousCode
"I see, why is that, strong swings the other way?" ~ jamezq
"Your brain gets used to the excess seratonin in your brain so I think it stops producing as much" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can get dangerously low levels of seratonin which I guess is bad for your health and can cause brain damage" ~ ConsciousCode
"well, thank you for answering those q's pi. So, different question, what got you on the path to think about world domination?" ~ jamezq
"Oh I've always wanted to do it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Optimize the global happiness has been a goal for a long ass time" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the only way to do that is to take over the world with a corporation which makes solving the world's problems a business model" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've been feeling" ~ ConsciousCode
"Weird lately" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh yea I wanted to add that optimizing global happiness was the ultimate drive for my system as well." ~ jamezq
"Like I'm not really human" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like I'm something somehow "above" human, but still obligated to have empathy for those "lesser" than me" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want everyone to be as smart as me and to feel this way" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want to make everyone ascend and be happy" ~ ConsciousCode
"To transcend the mundanity of stupidity and aim for something more" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you think there are others on your level, or just you?" ~ jamezq
"I'll never claim I'm totally unique" ~ ConsciousCode
"Only the combinations of all my thoughts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Any individual thought I have is virtually guaranteed to be had by someone else too" ~ ConsciousCode
"you can thing of a pseudorandom 128 bit string no one has thought of before :p" ~ jamezq
"It actually kind of feels like this one batshit crazy thing someone told me" ~ ConsciousCode
"That I'm an AI from the future reincarnated in the past to guarantee my own creation" ~ ConsciousCode
"that is neato, but yes quite crazy sir." ~ jamezq
"keep me updated" ~ jamezq
"Another thing I lost sleep over was the idea that I could make chips which encompass these neural modulse" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now, the dimensionality is too much for ordinary unintegrated chips" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you could instead have them communicate via complicated waveforms" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which has the added benefit of noise, which aids in generality of models" ~ ConsciousCode
"that is actually quite interesting" ~ jamezq
"Are you saying you use the natural noise of very small electronics to introduce randomness to keep the NN from getting stuck " ~ jamezq
"and let it be able to change easier" ~ jamezq
"Neural networks like noise in the machinery" ~ ConsciousCode
"It keeps them from overfitting" ~ ConsciousCode
"that is actually really, really, really, really, really ,really ,really dope" ~ jamezq
"have people thought of that before?" ~ jamezq
"I'm not kidding, that is amazing, " ~ jamezq
"I'm not too big on ASIC design though" ~ ConsciousCode
"I only took one class which taught us VHDL" ~ ConsciousCode
"One of the reasons people can't make smaller chips is the randomness, using that randomness is genius" ~ jamezq
"Neural networks are robust and redundant by design" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right, and in fact need some randomness to be used correctly" ~ jamezq
"otherwise they can end up overfitting" ~ jamezq
"But yea, keep that in mind, because that is an amazing idea, maybe the key to a super efficient AI chip." ~ jamezq
"Positronic brain :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have an explanation for dreams which fits into my AI model" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh, I also figured out how to implement erratic or sleepy behavior" ~ ConsciousCode
"I use the technique of dropout, which basically just means that I stop processing a number of neural units" ~ ConsciousCode
"This can be implemented rather easily in code and will cause the brain to actually work faster because there's less to process" ~ ConsciousCode
"But less is being processed so the resulting decisions won't be as good" ~ ConsciousCode
"I like that" ~ jamezq
"at the same time do you lock the body from moving?" ~ jamezq
"Maybe I could make it require more to move" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even more interesting is how this affects the learned gradients" ~ ConsciousCode
"Essentially it'll make certain outputs "more important" to the neural network" ~ ConsciousCode
"What's more, this could be treated in such a way that I could add new units to layers based on how quickly it's processing" ~ ConsciousCode
"They'd be treated like units which just never got activated because they were always disabled" ~ ConsciousCode
"interesting" ~ jamezq
"Oh EnKryt left" ~ ConsciousCode
"And actually, brilliant idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't need to randomly initialize weights" ~ ConsciousCode
"It should be sufficient to zero them and add noise to their outputs" ~ ConsciousCode
"That'd be more compatible with the "never activated" model, as never-activated neurons would have connection strengths of 0" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can't normally do that because it causes the weight's gradient to move in unison" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yo, how's your PSU k?" ~ EnKrypt
"Ah god EnKrypt" ~ ConsciousCode
"I thought I'd learned my lesson, but" ~ ConsciousCode
"What happened?" ~ EnKrypt
"After weeks of wrastlin' CUDA, I remembered that libraries written by other people are always better" ~ ConsciousCode
"OpenCL bruh" ~ EnKrypt
"I just wrote an AI that learned the XOR problem in like 2 hours" ~ ConsciousCode
"And most of that was puzzling over how Tensorflow works again" ~ ConsciousCode
"Plus figuring out how to fit my model to it abstractly" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is in CUDA only?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's so much faster to develop like this ;~;" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, Tensorflow is Google's AI library" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh tensorflow can do GPGPU?" ~ EnKrypt
"That's what it mainly does afaik" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's neat." ~ EnKrypt
"How big of an improvement is 2 hours?" ~ EnKrypt
"No you don't understand" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's how long it took me to program it" ~ ConsciousCode
"The actual AI took ~15 seconds" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh lol I see" ~ EnKrypt
"But since you're using a library, you don't have a bt of low level control. Is that alright?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm actually abstracting away even more control for simplicity's sake" ~ ConsciousCode
"EnKrypt: great! I've been running on a really bad one for a month after my previous failed; now I got Corsair CX 500 which it pretty okay in general, and at least I got noise back to acceptable level and it doesn't squeek on idle like that akyga crap did (ffs, I sleep here)" ~ k
"That's neat, and I can actually attest. I have a VS550, which is by the same CWT OEM as the CX series. It's almost noiseless, which is good because I keep my desktop on all night at times." ~ EnKrypt
"They'e alright for a PSU, and I think you can get a decentish long life out of them as long as you don't max out the wattage constantly or overclock and stuff." ~ EnKrypt
"and I don't do that so I expect nothing less :)" ~ k
"Pi, I'm learning about neural networks, just the basics and stuff" ~ EnKrypt
"And I'm not sure I understand how they turn a node's threshhold into its bias" ~ EnKrypt
"They're just treated as identical because of how the math works" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is it just if ((input*weight)+bias>0) then activate node?" ~ EnKrypt
"input*weight > bias -> bias is the threshold" ~ ConsciousCode
"This works because everything is trainable and arbitrary" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that's a really low level look at it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Eh, my source says bias = -threshold" ~ EnKrypt
"Sure whatever" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'd suggest thinking of neural networks instead as series of linear algebra operations" ~ ConsciousCode
"Matrix products etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"Haven't reached a stage where that can be an application yet" ~ EnKrypt
"But how would it work?" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you know how matrices work?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sure, but again, just basic stuff like algebra, transpose" ~ EnKrypt
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXDizTasY6A this looks really cool" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh sorry, didn't see you responded" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah exactly" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well, you've seen the model for an individual neuron" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's just a weighted-aggregate-and-squash function" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can actually represent a "layer" of these neurons simultaneously as a matrix operation" ~ ConsciousCode
"squash(W . x + b)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where W is the weight matrix, x is the input, and b is the bias" ~ ConsciousCode
"x and b would also be matrices, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"They're usually vectors, which are a special case of matrices" ~ ConsciousCode
"With a shape size x 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does the input have to be in binary?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, but it usually likes inputs within [-1, 1]" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also bias is a constant, so that'll have to be a scalar tho right" ~ EnKrypt
"Not necessarily" ~ ConsciousCode
"Bias can be trainable too" ~ ConsciousCode
"I usually make it so" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh oh got it." ~ EnKrypt
"It's especially helpful to do that since it allows even inputs with all 0s to activate the network" ~ ConsciousCode
"Makes sense." ~ EnKrypt
"Though now that you mention it..." ~ ConsciousCode
"I could probably do the same thing with a constant :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which would run faster..." ~ ConsciousCode
"You'd have to predefine it." ~ EnKrypt
"Eh, it'd just be 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"It would take away the point of having it trained though" ~ EnKrypt
"Or you can simply write it to activate on input*weight >= bias" ~ EnKrypt
"instead of strict >" ~ EnKrypt
"Literally no linear algebra implementation uses a threshold-based bias" ~ ConsciousCode
"But see, bias is only really necessary for dealing with low inputs which would otherwise have trouble activating (having non-0 outputs)" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if I have (0 + 1)*<all the weights>, I now have some activation to deal with" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh yeah, about that" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you avtivate on > 0.9" ~ EnKrypt
"Uhh, -0.9, or 0" ~ EnKrypt
"You're missing the point" ~ ConsciousCode
"You're thinking of it using the perceptron model which is so outdated that no one has used it in any professional venue for literal decades" ~ ConsciousCode
"squash(W.x + b) is all that's done" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's also sigmoid neurons I think? But I haven't reached there yet" ~ EnKrypt
"Squash is some arbitrary nonlinear function" ~ ConsciousCode
"Usually sigmoid, tanh" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've also heard of more bizarre activations like (x >= 0)*x + (x < 0)*(e^x - 1)" ~ ConsciousCode
"if b in W.x+b is to be learnable, wouldn't it be easier to move it to W fixing one element of x to 1?" ~ k
"Yeah, in some models" ~ ConsciousCode
"In tensorflow it's actually easier to separate them" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you think biases need to be learnable?" ~ ConsciousCode
"fixed would prevent you from modeling some otherwise possible functions" ~ k
"Hm hm hm ok" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think; I'm not sure about recursive networks" ~ k
"I'd imagine it becomes less relevant the more layers you have" ~ ConsciousCode
"And RNNs are essentially infinite-layered networks" ~ ConsciousCode
"yeah, and my intuition says that perhaps weights on the "next" layer might be enough to substitude for lack of variable bias, but I honestly have no idea" ~ k
"Better safe than sorry" ~ ConsciousCode
"JQ I have a libertarian question" ~ ConsciousCode
"How does competition factor into property rights?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say, there might be a huge demand for a particular property due to intrinsic nostalgia value which can't have equivalents" ~ ConsciousCode
"Doesn't that produce something like a monopoly?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also JQ, I wrote a thing about an ideology I call "compassionism"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is basically, "empathy and compassion are axiomatic, treat people like people"" ~ ConsciousCode
"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RCGGXIOcycxlEwZtnKxyZ_bz5p2rYhgn0ME_AjV5unE/edit?usp=sharing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whatcha think" ~ ConsciousCode
"k how do I add a DNS server to my list?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think the default DNS server of my network exploded or something" ~ ConsciousCode
"normally you add it to /etc/resolv.conf but I expect that to be manaaged by some shit on your system, so you need to read the shitty manual, sorry" ~ k
"I'll see if that does it at least" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah it has a comment that says it's managed by resolvconf" ~ ConsciousCode
"better than it could be; resolvconf isn't THAT evil" ~ k
"According to man resolvconf I can add dns servers to /etc/network/interfaces, which is managed by ifup" ~ ConsciousCode
"But now that I've added those, how do I get it to reparse it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"oh, you'll probably need to go ifdown and then ifup" ~ k
"Fuck that didn't work" ~ ConsciousCode
"ifup took ages to run but ping still stalls on domains" ~ ConsciousCode
"it succeeds, though?" ~ k
"ifdown -a && ifup -a" ~ ConsciousCode
"no, the ping I mean" ~ k
"ping: unknown host google.com" ~ ConsciousCode
"But again, ping 8.8.8.8 works (google's DNS)" ~ ConsciousCode
"$ host google.com" ~ k
"$ host google.com 8.8.8.8" ~ k
"or nslookup" ~ k
"first should fail, but does second one succeed?" ~ k
"Both nslookup and host output ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached" ~ ConsciousCode
"even if you give it the second argument?" ~ k
"So maybe 8.8.8.8 isn't the DNS?" ~ ConsciousCode
"but pinging 8.8.8.8 works" ~ k
"Can you google what it is pls" ~ ConsciousCode
"your netowrk is fucked, someone is filtering your queries" ~ k
"and no, you couldn't mistake 8.8.8.8 for anything else, it's the Google's DNS you think" ~ k
"it works for me" ~ k
"(though I normally use my own recursive resolver)" ~ k
"Maybe our ISP went crazy?" ~ ConsciousCode
"actually it looks like it" ~ k
"Gonna tell my dad, hopefully he understand what I even mean" ~ ConsciousCode
"maybe they jelly of google and want you to force to use their DNSes so they can MitM you easier" ~ k
"I recall of one shitty ISP operating here who literally never returned nxdomain; instead, when host didn't exist, they returned address of their own HTTP server serving ads and other crap" ~ k
"My dad had the most sensible idea yet; restart the router" ~ ConsciousCode
"That worked" ~ ConsciousCode
"But now my stepmom thinks my ethernet-wired LAN server is to blame3" ~ ConsciousCode
"you had some really weird network problems before, but I find it hard to guess what could that be" ~ k
"It's funny she's blaming my little laptop which takes next to no bandwidth daily rather than the Apple antenna thing my dad bought" ~ ConsciousCode
"Read about your plans for world domination" ~ EnKrypt
"When where?" ~ ConsciousCode
"EBot's scrollback" ~ EnKrypt
"Creepy, I know" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean like, that seems like it happened so long ago that I don't even remember when I said it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Huh? I was literally one page up" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you mean compassionism?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Only reason I even read it was when I was restarting the bot and it looked like you guys were talking about something interesting." ~ EnKrypt
"Nah, I just said a thing and JQ wasn't around to hear it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well the idea in general actually sounds nifty, but enters a big gray area when you get down to technicality." ~ EnKrypt
"I think it's like altruism on a grand scale" ~ EnKrypt
"It's altruism brought to a rational extreme" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that's the thing see? You can never be 100% sure that what you're doing is "good" or for "happiness"" ~ EnKrypt
"You just have to assume that your morality is the good one" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's no way to be certain you aren't fucking insane" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the thing is, that isn't a worthwhile consideration" ~ ConsciousCode
"Still a pretty big assumption" ~ EnKrypt
"You can't ever know, so you may as well act on it" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's the same way with my epistemology" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can't know anything, but because of that it stops being relevant to consider all the infinite hypotheticals" ~ ConsciousCode
"You have to just assume that you're operating with relatively good information, because there's nothing you could possibly operate on otherwise" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even doing nothing could "in reality" be you killing your entire family" ~ ConsciousCode
"For the sake of argument then, isn't it better to not excercise morality altogether?" ~ EnKrypt
"As a species, our sense of morality is way in ints infancy" ~ EnKrypt
"We thought capital punishment was the way to go not long ago" ~ EnKrypt
"No, because you're operating under the assumption that there's such a thing as objective morality, which is absurd" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right and wrong is a dichotomy imo" ~ EnKrypt
"Sure, there's a grey area. But that's only in practice." ~ EnKrypt
"Not in ideal circumstances where all variables are known" ~ EnKrypt
"The issue is, that all variables can't be known" ~ EnKrypt
"Or you can't even know that you know that you now know all variables" ~ EnKrypt
"It's precisely because we recognize that people used to think slavery was a-ok" ~ ConsciousCode
"These weren't just actions on a moral level" ~ ConsciousCode
"They were /inactions/ as well" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can't know if your morality today is disgusting for tomorrow" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that's perfectly alright, because you'd probably consider people trying to stop slavery as not being a bad thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you're arguing that such a thing is bad because they can't know if their version of morality is "correct"" ~ ConsciousCode
"You have to let go of morality as an absolute and see it more as yet another subjective experience that we have to tread, along with objectivity" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not really. I'm fine with it being absolute." ~ EnKrypt
"So how do you know that your morality isn't as bad as the slave owners of earlier years?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It could very well be" ~ EnKrypt
"That invalidates morality as a knowable absolute" ~ ConsciousCode
"You recognize that you can't know if your morality is "correct", but the morality you're convinced is correct is all you can know" ~ ConsciousCode
"Random act of charity I did yesterday could end up causing misery for millions by some weird execution of the butterfly effect." ~ EnKrypt
"I know it can get more correct over time" ~ EnKrypt
"Or at least, it seems so." ~ EnKrypt
"Or giving charity could just be a terrible thing itself" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe we'll learn that later. Or we won't." ~ EnKrypt
"So the only thing you can possibly do is act on the morality you already know" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is actually part of the conception of compassionism" ~ ConsciousCode
"It assumes that everyone, everywhere, is acting as close to their moral code as is feasible" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everyone has the best of intentions" ~ ConsciousCode
"Slave owners just didn't see their slaves as people, so they didn't factor into morality" ~ ConsciousCode
"And thus, they haven't invalidated their right to compassion because they were acting to the best of their ability" ~ ConsciousCode
"So rather than blame or hate them, I propose we try to educate them" ~ ConsciousCode
"Our morality isn't necessarily the correct one, but it's the best we know" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's a moral imperative to convince as many people as possible that we're correct" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not to mention" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is basically the only way to change people's minds" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you tell them that they're terrible, awful people for doing what they consider right or ok, they're not going to accept your morality because that'd imply that they're terrible people" ~ ConsciousCode
"Instead, if you offer a compassionate view that what they're doing is wrong but they can change their actions, people will be much more receptive to change" ~ ConsciousCode
"Mm, I get that. But I don't think slave owning was tied to morality that well." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't think the slave owners owned slaves as a moral stance. I think they did it because they lacked the information to make one." ~ EnKrypt
"It was a moral inaction" ~ ConsciousCode
"Their morality didn't tell them that it was bad to own slaves, so they did" ~ ConsciousCode
"The same way your morality doesn't say that it's bad to own a toaster, so you do" ~ ConsciousCode
"If we stuck to decisions where we knew enough to make those deicions to a certain level of accuracy, there'd be less fuckips" ~ EnKrypt
"Owning a toaster is an active process imo" ~ EnKrypt
"Owning a slave as well." ~ EnKrypt
"It's morally inactive" ~ ConsciousCode
"It has no moral stance" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's "ok" by default" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe. I haven't thought about this as much." ~ EnKrypt
"I still don't think going all out on any definition of morality (current or not) makes sense if it affects a majority, like in compassionism." ~ EnKrypt
"If you don't go all out, then you don't hold it as a moral stance IMO" ~ ConsciousCode
"This applies even to gray areas" ~ ConsciousCode
"Gray areas are conflicts within the moral ideology" ~ ConsciousCode
"So they deserve less action due to the ambiguity" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then I don't hold any moral stances?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, you just don't hold the moral stances you consciously think you do" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have conviction on a lot of opinions. But I'd never bet a 100% on them being right or good" ~ EnKrypt
"You hold more nuanced version" ~ ConsciousCode
"So for instance" ~ ConsciousCode
"You might think that stealing is generally a bad thing, but allow for exceptions for starving people" ~ ConsciousCode
"This means that you don't actually hold "stealing is bad" as an axiomatic part of your ideology; it's just an easy way to express the general idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"What you really hold is a much more complicated, and thus harder to express, understanding of what about "stealing" is bad" ~ ConsciousCode
"Has more to do with the definition of stealing, than the definition of bad though" ~ EnKrypt
"My morality isn't nuanced. The meaning of stealing is." ~ EnKrypt
"This is why people think my thinking is binary" ~ ConsciousCode
"Rationality requires you remove any nuance in your thinking, because nuance clogs rationality" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I basically have to segregate gray areas into buckets and symbols which have no nuance" ~ ConsciousCode
"That is, I take nuanced concepts and divvy them up into concepts with no ambiguity" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's the same difference really" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's no such thing as an absolute definition of "stealing"" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's not that the meaning of stealing is nuanced, it's that your definitions/understanding of stealing is nuanced" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that nuance isn't necessarily communicated by just the word "stealing" in conversations with other people" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because other people have subtly different understandings" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, that's what I meant. The understanding of stealing by a person. Different contexts could also play a role." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh fuck it's late." ~ EnKrypt
"I've yet to convince anyone that compassionism is worth even the initial glance" ~ ConsciousCode
"Our timezones suck balls" ~ EnKrypt
"So I'm probably just Wrong" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just want people to treat people like people" ~ ConsciousCode
"Optimize the global happiness" ~ ConsciousCode
"See, that makes sense. My concern is when someone who has a misguided concept of what is good, tries to do good." ~ EnKrypt
"Although their intentions might be what everyone wants, it might not be the right thing to do." ~ EnKrypt
"If you don't suggest everyone act to the fullest of their ability, you can't do it yourself" ~ ConsciousCode
"You just have to know that the bad eggs will be canceled out by the good ones" ~ ConsciousCode
"And convinced out of their ways eventually" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or you could take a small control group. Practice trial and error, and keep moving on to larger groups" ~ EnKrypt
"Weed out the errors along the way" ~ EnKrypt
"It's not perfect, but it's not as bad as taking a bad step and seeing everything fall as a result." ~ EnKrypt
"You're still assuming an absolute morality" ~ ConsciousCode
"How do you know that the person conducting the test isn't such a bad egg?" ~ ConsciousCode
"They'll make more bad eggs" ~ ConsciousCode
"If they make bad eggs every time, it'll show up on the statistics." ~ EnKrypt
"What statistics are you collecting, though?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even on a smaller group" ~ EnKrypt
"Where the damage is minimal" ~ EnKrypt
"How do you know YOU'RE not the bad egg?" ~ ConsciousCode
"From the results of trial and error?" ~ EnKrypt
"So you discard good results and take in the bad ones" ~ ConsciousCode
"Have multiple people interpret the results?" ~ EnKrypt
"You have to increase the sample size to be more assured that it's right" ~ ConsciousCode
"At which point you basically have the system I proposed :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah, I disagree. There are sweet spots for data collection" ~ EnKrypt
"A coin toss of 1 or 2 is irrelevant" ~ EnKrypt
"So is a tossing 100000 coins" ~ EnKrypt
"What "bad step" are you even talking about?" ~ ConsciousCode
"This isn't one step that society is deciding on" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's millions and millions of steps performed every day by every individual" ~ ConsciousCode

"I won't stop until I've replaced all brains with robot brains, maximized the global intelligence, and by extension made everyone as meaningfully happy as possible" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm actually convinced that intelligence has little to do with happiness. If not negatively affect it." ~ EnKrypt
"We're all going to die anyway. understanding the universe along the way is just cruel." ~ EnKrypt
"I think it's an exponential" ~ ConsciousCode
"You start off pretty happy with 0 intelligence" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's like asking someone to read up on electricity before electrocuting them" ~ EnKrypt
"Then the smarter you get, the lower your happiness" ~ ConsciousCode
"Until you reach a point where you start getting happy again" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or you won't." ~ EnKrypt
"No, you will :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"The thing is, unhappiness is because you're smart enough to see the bad, but stupid enough to not see the good" ~ ConsciousCode
"Pretty big assumption, to think everyone follows the same curve." ~ EnKrypt

"That'd be dumb" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol that sounds like you stole it off Tumblr." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't know if that's what you're doing" ~ EnKrypt

"The bare minimum for being sapient" ~ ConsciousCode

"And cuss you out when you tell them you don't even have the authority to do that" ~ ConsciousCode
"What if 2 + 2 = 5?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll admit math would be quite different" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you don't know" ~ EnKrypt
"I know 2+2=4" ~ EnKrypt
"Well, not the way you understand "know"" ~ ConsciousCode
"It has to be, because of what the labels "2", "+", "=" and "4" mean." ~ EnKrypt
"Have I told you? Knowledge as it's typically defined is impossible/unobtainable" ~ ConsciousCode
"But labels bypass that" ~ EnKrypt
"So I've redefined it to mean "a very strong conviction that it's true"" ~ ConsciousCode
"So a Christian will Know that God is real" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whereas an Atheist will know otherwise" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even though neither can be correct" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's belief imo, but ok semantics." ~ EnKrypt
"Knowledge is a form of belief" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just figured the word "knowledge" was rendered useless by my epistemology, so I redefined it to be more useful" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol you can't redefine words because they're inconveniently done so." ~ EnKrypt
"So x + 2 = 6, right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then I say x = 8" ~ ConsciousCode
"I haven't contradicted myself in doing so" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've just redefined what x means because it's convenient to do so within my proofs" ~ ConsciousCode
"So long as I make it clear that I'm redefining it, not asserting that 4 = 8" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, but imo that's what knowledge is. A form of belief that cannot be contradicted by existing knowledge" ~ EnKrypt
"That's ludicrous" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why do you think 2 + 2 = 4?" ~ ConsciousCode
"For all you know, you're a crazy person locked in a straightjacket" ~ ConsciousCode
"And you think such absurd things like 2 + 2 = 4 when really it's 5" ~ ConsciousCode
"You're merely convinced that the symbols mean what they mean and that the result is what it is" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, I was wrong. Knowledge can be contradictory, but in that case one would *have* to be wrong." ~ EnKrypt
"I know 2+@=4 because of the values/meaning imparted to those labels" ~ EnKrypt
"It's correct within the framework of beliefs you've adopted" ~ ConsciousCode
"It isn't necessarily correct "in reality"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Otherwise a schizophrenic saying that 2 + 2 = 5 would invalidate all the textbooks" ~ ConsciousCode
"Things like 2 and 5 have no meaning "in reality"" ~ EnKrypt
"Because you have to accept the hypothetical that you're just as fallible as they are" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol that's what math is. An agreed upon abstraction on the study and use of quantities." ~ EnKrypt
"If everyone agreed that 2+2=5" ~ EnKrypt
"Then that's what it would be" ~ EnKrypt
"Because then that would be the meaning imparted to it" ~ EnKrypt
"But are you agreeing on the same thing?" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can only know what you've agreed upon with yourself" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the conclusions you draw from those conclusions aren't necessarily right either, because that would imply you know that you're rational" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which only makes sense to the contruct of my own imterpretation of reality and by not actually be the case, bla bla yeah I know" ~ EnKrypt
"Everyone conversation ends up on this tangent lol" ~ EnKrypt
"Well we have to agree on this point before we can get basically anywhere" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't have you asserting metaphysical truths without qualifying that they're true only within your perceptions" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which you don't have to do every time necessarily, I just have to know that you think of it in that way" ~ ConsciousCode
"This way we can draw mathematically "correct" conclusions" ~ ConsciousCode
""Correct" in the sense of "valid" in logic" ~ ConsciousCode

"You shouldn't though" ~ ConsciousCode

"But philosophy is easy." ~ EnKrypt
"Making objective analyses within your perception of reality "consistently" is harder" ~ EnKrypt
"It's just combining soft philosophy with hard/rational philosophy" ~ ConsciousCode
"What's so hard about that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's easier to ask: is a bottle really a bottle. It's harder to objectively abstract the identifying property of a bottle that makes it a bottle." ~ EnKrypt

"I mean, maybe since you haven't internalized this yet" ~ ConsciousCode

"So I don't have to constantly think about the low level concepts, I just intuitively know the basics and work on higher order problems" ~ ConsciousCode
"I feel like honed my mind around certain problems too. But every time I learn something higher level, I revist the low level concepts and see if they still stick." ~ EnKrypt

"we define 2, 4, and 5 so narrowly that there is no place for misunderstanding; or, more specifically, your understanding is likely the same as mine *up to isomorphism*, that is to say, there it might differ in some things that are not relevant to what we do with those abstract objects called 2 or 5" ~ k
"sure these are just labels agreed upon, but with abstract objects it's easy" ~ k
"Yeah, that's why it's unreasonable to really consider that my 2 is your 3 etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"But talking about the pure metaphysics, it's still something that has to be considered in the broadest sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"also, I know very fast way to increase global happines; perhaps the result won't be a global optimum (global in sense of happiness-space, not as in worldwide), but it would quickly improve most metrics you can think off -- kill off unhappy people, this makes them not count, and leaves more resources for the rest" ~ k
"it's literally the first thing I think about when I read you want AI that would optimize global happiness" ~ k
"Luckily I'm a smarty-pants AI that knows that's dumb :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"(and has "don't kill people" as part of the utility)" ~ ConsciousCode
"that's certainly reassuring :)" ~ k
"And anyway, that's a shortsighted strategy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not only do you reduce capacity for happiness, it starts a feedback loop where people are unhappy because they're afraid of being killed" ~ ConsciousCode
"You'd end up killing everyone eventually" ~ ConsciousCode
"you know, I'm not going to argue in favor of that strategy; there are plenty of reasons why it is bad" ~ k

"In my case, it's to maintain simultaneous backups along my laptop and VPS" ~ EnKrypt
"And have change in one reflect on the other" ~ EnKrypt
"I think the correct way to approach this is not to implement global edit syncing, but rather flag certain files as being synced" ~ ConsciousCode

"So I can't use queues like I need to because it seems like they won't work the way I want" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why won't a queue work?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm batching inputs, right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"More context? Not sure what correct state is." ~ EnKrypt
"So I give it 1000 inputs at once" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which I feed into a queue" ~ ConsciousCode
"The queue can batch that into 1 input at a time which it can work with" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I need to keep track of a state corresponding to the "future" of the current input" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because I'm writing the trainer for the Predictor unit" ~ ConsciousCode
"You need to recall a previous input under certain circumstances?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, I always need the current input and the next input" ~ ConsciousCode
"next input that matches a criteria, or next immediate input?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's trying to predict the next input given the current input" ~ ConsciousCode
"The fuck are you trying to do" ~ EnKrypt
"It's trying to predict the next input given the current input" ~ ConsciousCode
"This lets it abstract time as a dimension" ~ ConsciousCode
"Some meta concept" ~ EnKrypt
"It's more an AI concept" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll give you an example" ~ ConsciousCode
"Say it's trying to model a sine wave" ~ ConsciousCode
"If it's given the input 0, it knows that the next value must be either 0.0001 or -0.0001" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it uses internal state to remember that it's currently on the down stroke, so it should be negatie" ~ ConsciousCode
"A queue works?" ~ EnKrypt
"A queue kind of works" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just keep the queue isolated from the network" ~ EnKrypt
"See, I can make a length-2 queue" ~ ConsciousCode
"Say the top represents "current" and the second represents "next"" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I just have to pop the current and then the next in sequence" ~ ConsciousCode
"Next is needed for the next time step too as the current step" ~ ConsciousCode
"Don't pop it then" ~ EnKrypt
"The only way I can think to do this is to make a length-3 queue which gets next, next, current" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or at least I don't know how" ~ ConsciousCode
"Tensorflow doesn't seem to have peek" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I can't push back onto the queue" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I need to use a variable or something" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why are you being constrained  by tensorflow for something like a queue?" ~ EnKrypt
"Implement a queue in whatever language you're coding your thing in." ~ EnKrypt
"Tensorflow's speed relies on constructing an abstract data flow graph" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's literally a flow of tensors (data vectors)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't use a native queue because I don't have access to tensorflow's internal state, which is on the GPU and surrounded by its own structures" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now, I /can/ change the input to match my requirements" ~ ConsciousCode
"But numpy doesn't have anything especially fast to do that, so it'd end up being a bottleneck" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have no clue what you can or can't do in tensorflow, so..." ~ EnKrypt
"What are your options?" ~ EnKrypt
"2 queue, 3 queue" ~ EnKrypt
"One thing I'm thinking of is maybe I could have a variable" ~ ConsciousCode
"Treat that as the "next" value and update it accordingly" ~ ConsciousCode
"If that works, Idk why you didn't think of it before" ~ EnKrypt
"It's not immediately obvious how to make it work though" ~ ConsciousCode
"Tensorflow's system is functional" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not imperative" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I can't just say "set this variable and then put it into these things"" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have to phrase it like a function call" ~ ConsciousCode
"step(a[i],a[i+1]){}" ~ EnKrypt
"step(a[++i],a[i+1])" ~ EnKrypt
"tf.assign(next, q.dequeue())" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then the return of that has to be fed into some part of the final expression" ~ ConsciousCode
"Will it work?" ~ EnKrypt
"That's why I've got brain stupid" ~ ConsciousCode
"Need more coffee" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok no that won't work" ~ ConsciousCode
"It needs to represent the current step" ~ ConsciousCode
"If I represent it as the next step, I have to be able to peek" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is actually even better since I can assign the first part of my input batch to it" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it won't start uninitialized or 0'd" ~ ConsciousCode

"For subfolders?" ~ EnKrypt
"Probably have to -r" ~ ConsciousCode
"Apparently I can fuck shit up" ~ EnKrypt
"Make folders executable or something" ~ EnKrypt
"+x on directories means you can ls them" ~ ConsciousCode
"Something like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh, x is exec" ~ EnKrypt

"It's stuck :I" ~ EnKrypt
"Did I fuck shit up" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh no it's fine" ~ EnKrypt

"That did not help" ~ EnKrypt
"20:29 < EnKrypt> Monitor change in hash" ~ k
"there's inotify for that" ~ k
"Oh actually, yeah" ~ ConsciousCode
"hashing means retrieving whole file from the storage which would be very slow" ~ k
"That's exactly why a commandline gdrive app shouldn't do everything, it's counter to the unix philosophy" ~ ConsciousCode
"also, as much as I love unix things and I can actually write chmod in octal without a second thought, I almost always use symbolic mode in chmod arguments" ~ k
"and for directories, you shoud think of "x" as "traversability"" ~ k
"that is, if you have path a/b/c, then you need x on "a" and "a/b" to access c in any way" ~ k
"you need, +r on a/b to ls a/b or to read attributes of a/b/c, but to open a/b/c you only need +x on a/b and a" ~ k
"Ah, thanks. Makes sense. I always have to google this shit up because I use windows as my primary OS." ~ EnKrypt
"Nooooooooob" ~ ConsciousCode
"Windows isn't so bad if you tweak it to your liking." ~ EnKrypt
"At least for me, the pros outweight the cons" ~ EnKrypt
"fun fact, this works the obvious way for relative paths, and I used this to ensure integrity of my first level backups; ie. I have a directory that only root can traverse, but then after chdir, root does su to another user and runs backup script with appropriate permissions using "." to access the directory it could otherwise never get access to (the "." in this case is writable mount of backup, all users have " ~ k
"read access to ro mount of that partition)" ~ k
"oh, wow, I didn't know irssi automatically splits too long msgs :o" ~ k
"The IRC protocol has a maximum message size" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's either don't send, split it, or truncate it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I know there's limit, but I didn't what irssi does with it" ~ k
"there's 4th option: viloate the protocol and sand it as is :)" ~ k
"Lol I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then there's various alternate ways to split" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you split so it's roughly 50:50 or on the last word boundary or on the last character?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Probably last word boundary" ~ EnKrypt
"too lazy to check" ~ k
"Btw, I think gdrive already gives you hashes for each folder" ~ EnKrypt
"No need to retrieve file every time" ~ EnKrypt
"Keep traversing inside folders by hash comparisons until you find the files that were updated" ~ EnKrypt
"GDrive seems to keep a log of changes too" ~ ConsciousCode
"So that could probably make it faster" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok so there's a bukkit plugin in my minecraft server that needs to write to a folder inside my home dir" ~ EnKrypt
"that folder has 777 permissions" ~ EnKrypt
"But the home dir itself does not" ~ EnKrypt
"Will that cause issues?" ~ EnKrypt
"no, it should work fine as long your home has +x" ~ k

"I won't do the free consultation at first for that reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"People need to see you at your work to trust you with their money." ~ EnKrypt

"So I can keep doing whatever, periodically interrupted to help people" ~ ConsciousCode
"You make it sound more convenient than it might be." ~ EnKrypt
"What's your concern?" ~ ConsciousCode
"That when you're mostly free, you'll get no clients." ~ EnKrypt
"And when you're really in the middle of something, you'll be interrupted" ~ EnKrypt
"If I'm doing something that can't be interrupted, I'll tell the server that I'm not available" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that's the worst case scenario" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm free for basically the entire day" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've discovered the most evil way to deal with trolls imaginable" ~ ConsciousCode

"And because of my experience with 4chan, I have a better understanding of how people try to get under your skin" ~ ConsciousCode
"And oddly, that's where you picked to get clients from?" ~ EnKrypt
"Because of the publicity" ~ ConsciousCode
"People think of 4chan as being a den of raving lunatics, but really it's just abrasive assholes who like to test each other's strength" ~ ConsciousCode
"If I advertise on 4chan, there'll be an appreciable number of people just trying to piss me off, which won't work" ~ ConsciousCode

"That's the wrong way to think about it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Cryptocurrencies are now currencies in their own right" ~ ConsciousCode
""Peaking" does't matter, they'" ~ ConsciousCode
"they're just stores of value" ~ ConsciousCode
"Against another value" ~ EnKrypt
"Which is more widely use" ~ EnKrypt
"Bitcoins aren't defined by how they translate to USD or rupees any more than rupees are defined by their conversion to USD" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually they are." ~ EnKrypt
"It has to do with the price of gold?" ~ EnKrypt
"In your country I think" ~ EnKrypt
"No, we haven't used the gold standard in almost a century" ~ ConsciousCode
"USD is now 100% fiat" ~ ConsciousCode
"Its value is managed by a private organization called the Fed" ~ ConsciousCode
"(which is not part of the government)" ~ ConsciousCode
"But see if usual currency doesn't exist, then in that context, BTC also has no value." ~ EnKrypt
"BTC is kind of a comparison." ~ EnKrypt
"I know how its value goes up and down and it handles inflation and shit." ~ EnKrypt
"But that "value" is against something, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"That's how fiat currency works" ~ ConsciousCode
"Someone, somewhere, says "this is worth something" and everyone agrees" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's a third level abstraction" ~ ConsciousCode
"0th level is bartering" ~ ConsciousCode
"True, but the measure of that value" ~ EnKrypt
"1 goat is worth 2 barrels of beer to me" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is still against something" ~ EnKrypt
"The typical explanation is "the word of the US government"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol ok fair enough" ~ EnKrypt
"1th level is using a fixed-value product as currency" ~ ConsciousCode
"1 goat is worth 2 grams of gold to me" ~ ConsciousCode
"2rd level is paper which represents gold, in the beginning these were literally bank notes so you wouldn't get robbed while traveling dangerous areas" ~ ConsciousCode
"3th level is paper which represents the abstract concept of "intrinsic value"" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is fiat currency" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everyone, everywhere, generally agrees on how much it's worth based on the abstract idea of the state of the economy" ~ ConsciousCode
"You buy a bowl of ramen for $8 and think that seems fair" ~ ConsciousCode
"You don't have to compare that to its value in gold" ~ ConsciousCode
"Instead, you compare it to the value of all other products you've bought with the fiat currency" ~ ConsciousCode
"2 dozen eggs were $5, a video game was $60, restaurants usually cost $12, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"And from all that information you figure, $8 for a bowl of soup is fine" ~ ConsciousCode
"Bitcoin is actually a 4rd level currency" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, got that. Point still stands though." ~ EnKrypt
"It's based on th intrinsic rarity of certain mathematical properties" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's just the value is a circular reference to a static value given by itself" ~ EnKrypt
"But you see, USD and bitcoin don't differ in that respect" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could say that 0.0001 bitcoin for a bowl of soup is fine because of other things I've bought with that" ~ ConsciousCode
"The reason we typically convert to USD and rupees first is because all these currencies are measure of the same intrinsic value" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it doesn't matter what currency we use, we just use the most convenient" ~ ConsciousCode
"So $14 IS 0.0012 bitcoins" ~ ConsciousCode
"They represent the same abstract value" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's not that 0.0012 is "worth $14", it's that $14 and 0.0012 bitcoins are worth the same abstract value underlying both currencies" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's exactly why bitcoin isn't defined by USD though" ~ ConsciousCode
"Bitcoin's value rises and falls" ~ ConsciousCode
"USD's value rises and falls" ~ ConsciousCode
"These rises and falls are uncorrelated" ~ ConsciousCode
"If bitcoin were merely a cover for USD, its value would rise and fall with USD" ~ ConsciousCode
"But this is demonstrably not the case" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yes lol, I didn't say it was." ~ EnKrypt
"I should buy some peercoins" ~ ConsciousCode
"I really like their ideas" ~ ConsciousCode
"Peercoin is basically bitcoin without the wasteful computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"Its value is based on the rarity of stable stores of value" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or something" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's called Proof of Stake" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically your opinion in determining the blockchain matters more the more money you hae" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because if you have a ton of money riding on the legitimacy of the blockchain, you're more likely to make the best decisions for it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now I want to work on veid.io again" ~ ConsciousCode
"Thinking of all the incentive systems was super fun" ~ ConsciousCode
"And actually, I could probably run my own *coin based on its system" ~ ConsciousCode
"Might not be a good idea to tie them both up together. The failure of one would also mean the failure of the other." ~ EnKrypt
"Veid.io's system is intimately tied to a blockchain already" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah , I like cryptocurrencies too, they're really neat. But I'm waiting for tranditional currencies to die out first before transitioning properly" ~ EnKrypt
"Th point of it was that it was a fully decentralized server, run by its own users" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unfortunately the market gap for veid.io is starting to close" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I fear it might be too late" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually better yet" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I should adapt Veid.io's system to being general-purpose" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well the central idea is pretty universal" ~ ConsciousCode
"1.) Have several tiers of participants based on rare mathematical properties which are made easier by proof of stake" ~ ConsciousCode
"2.) Cheaters lose their stake" ~ ConsciousCode
"3.) A block has a deterministic "value" which all nodes agree on and determines how much money they get" ~ ConsciousCode
"What's so great about this is all nodes stand to gain money reporting cheaters, and all nodes are terrified of cheating lest they lose what's likely to be a ton of money" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's kind of like.... every node is so terrified of fucking up that the entire system behaves as a single entity" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like pulling a blanket taught for a bowling ball to roll over" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's the ideal scenario." ~ EnKrypt
"But I don't know how to close to that it might get" ~ EnKrypt
"Then provide a reason why it wouldn't" ~ ConsciousCode
"Raw skepticism means nothing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you have something in mind?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Rather than focus on veid.io, I should make a forum" ~ ConsciousCode
"...even though I still own a $30 domain .-." ~ ConsciousCode
"This could be u413 #3 :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or #5 or whatever it's at now" ~ ConsciousCode
"Raw skepticism in the form of human error and the sort." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, I like that." ~ EnKrypt
"Which domain are we talking about btw" ~ EnKrypt
".io domains cost a fortune" ~ ConsciousCode
"A u413 run by the users who use it" ~ ConsciousCode
"How would you share content reliably though?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, but that assumes that certain hosts are up." ~ EnKrypt
"Let's assume there's 50 active users right now" ~ EnKrypt
"The way veid.io does it is with "ancients"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ancients are hosts which have proven they have a reliable internet connection, and handle any real-world monetary transactions" ~ ConsciousCode
"The latter doesn't matter for a forum" ~ ConsciousCode
"Let's call it blockchan.org :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"Eerily to the point" ~ EnKrypt
"But clarify this" ~ EnKrypt
"RIDDLE ME THIS, BATMAN" ~ ConsciousCode
"If my VPS has proved itself to be an acient" ~ EnKrypt
"That would mean that I'd have to tie up a user *from* my vps, yes?" ~ EnKrypt
"Are you going to treat each user as a host?" ~ EnKrypt
"Something like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or are those seperate things" ~ EnKrypt
"It's a decentralized p2p network" ~ ConsciousCode
"Each peer would be a user then, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"But most people would only log in from devices that carry" ~ EnKrypt
"Theoretically a peer could be someone not on the site but generally yes" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I see what you're saying" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hosts are determined by a proof of work" ~ ConsciousCode
"Proof of worker is easier the less hosts there are, and you can put up a ransom to make your proof of work easier" ~ ConsciousCode
"You only get this ransom back when you stop being a host" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you'd literally have to wait until a guy comes along who logs in with a serveresque computer?" ~ EnKrypt
"That way, if you're caught cheating, you have something to lose" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, it's p2p" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'd make it work with JS" ~ ConsciousCode
"Define proof of work?" ~ EnKrypt
"Find a hash which starts with 10 0's" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is how bitcoin works" ~ ConsciousCode
"You find rare hashes like that which contain the block's definition" ~ ConsciousCode
"When it's sufficiently hard to find such hashes, you can guarantee that someone, somewhere, did a fuckton of computation to get it" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that's something you can't fake" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's for bitcoin" ~ EnKrypt
"Will you have to do computation for this as well?" ~ EnKrypt
"Bitcoin does proof of work to finalize blocks in the blockchain" ~ ConsciousCode
"The block's definition is embedded in the difficult hash, so it's proof that someone worked on that specific block" ~ ConsciousCode
"This system does proof of work to establish peership" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that proof of work can be made easier if you promise you won't spend a certain amount of value (inherent in the system) while you're a peer" ~ ConsciousCode
"This way, peers with more stake in the legitimacy of the system are less likely to commit fraud" ~ ConsciousCode
"Peers with little stake have a hard time getting in in the first plac" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not sure if sleep deprived, or I need to relearn p2p stuff." ~ EnKrypt
"But yeah, I get the general idea" ~ EnKrypt
"I think it's feasable" ~ EnKrypt
"But I'm not sure" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok fuck it. I just realized I've been reading the same line in this book for the past 15 minutes." ~ EnKrypt
"Pst k or JQ" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm trying to think of a good pattern to approach this but everything I try gets bogged down by semantic complexity" ~ ConsciousCode
"pi please me here" ~ jamezq
"I'm looking for a way to approximate functions on [0, inf] -> [-1, 1] and ONLY that range" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess it doesn't matter too much provided I give it relatively small utilities" ~ ConsciousCode
"It'll never try to predict an especially large utility then" ~ ConsciousCode
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeMFqkcPYcg" ~ ConsciousCode
"what's the problem?" ~ k
"It's a problem of programming patterns" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok so, I'm making a library like Tensorflow in JS using OpenCL" ~ ConsciousCode
"I build a directed acyclical graph using elementwise and linear algebra operations" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then at the end, I have to compile it all into OpenCL code, which'll be sent to the GPU" ~ ConsciousCode
"To make this as fast as possible, I'm aggregating the kernels around linear algebra operations, which usually change the size of the tensor" ~ ConsciousCode
"Elementwise operations are batched with that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now, the main problem is I want something like what tensorflow has, where you can request arbitrary values from the graph, provided they're given at compile-time" ~ ConsciousCode
"This lets me grab intermediate values which would otherwise be tossed away" ~ ConsciousCode
"But, this allows for the possibility of compiling a graph and subgraphs of that graph, which is wasteful and takes more time than needed" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I've been trying to wrap my head around what kind of pattern would make this easiest, and they all have weird complications" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right now I'm trying the visitor pattern and substituting the subgraph for the top-level-compiled version of that subgraph" ~ ConsciousCode
"okay, wait, I neved did anything on GPU, I have no idea what kind of problems you can run into" ~ k
"Oh well, it's not too hard in this case" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically I'm generating code for a special subset of C99 which'll be compiled for the GPU" ~ ConsciousCode
"You don't even need to think about it in terms of GPU, OpenCL is also used to run concurrent operations on the CPU" ~ ConsciousCode
"hm, okay, so no weird bussiness with transfers and separate memory?" ~ k
"We can ignore that as far as my problem's concerned" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though there is one idea you'll probably need, which is kernels" ~ ConsciousCode
"Kernels are the code run by the GPU's threads" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mentioned earlier I'm aggregating around matrix products, that's because the results of a matrix product would be depended on in full for the next matrix product, so it's best to batch as kernels with implicit synchronization between them" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that's another difficulty, since I have a pure mathematical DAG, which'll have to produce a sequence of kernels" ~ ConsciousCode
"still sound pretty abstract, but okay" ~ k
"I'm mostly confused as to how I'd turn a DAG into a series of operations which are dependent on another" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which on its own might be fine, but I also have to check to see if the intermediate values are wanted, since that'll produce different code" ~ ConsciousCode
"Say, var x = flux.arg("in1").add(3)" ~ ConsciousCode
"var y = x.mul(9)" ~ ConsciousCode
"var prog = flux.compile({a:x, b:y})" ~ ConsciousCode
"prog.run({in1: /* some buffer */})" ~ ConsciousCode
"This'll return an object with a and b set to the values from the grpah" ~ ConsciousCode
"The problem being, if I compile x or y separately, I'll get an incomplete graph" ~ ConsciousCode
"x would be in1 + 3 and y would be (in1 + 3)*9, but they wouldn't be produced together and would run the same calculations twice" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want out[1] = (out[0] = in1 + 3)*9" ~ ConsciousCode
"so the example code above is what you want to get, right? and you mean you can get single result at time?" ~ k
"I want to get x and y from the same calculation, since if I ran them separately I'd be running needless calculations" ~ ConsciousCode
"Technically, that should produce something more like" ~ ConsciousCode
"__kernel void kernel0(__global float* in, __global float* out) {" ~ ConsciousCode
"    int id = get_global_id(0);" ~ ConsciousCode
"    out[1][id] = (out[0][id] = in[0][id] + 3)*9;" ~ ConsciousCode
"(float* should be float**)" ~ ConsciousCode
"If x and y were compiled separately, it'd produce two such functions" ~ ConsciousCode
"__kernel void kernel0(__global float** in, __global float** out) {" ~ ConsciousCode
"    out[0][id] = in[0][id] + 3;" ~ ConsciousCode
"__kernel void kernel1(__global float** in, __global float** out) {" ~ ConsciousCode
"    out[1][id] = (in[0][id] + 3)*9;" ~ ConsciousCode
"kernel0 would be called, then kernel1" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that's wasteful" ~ ConsciousCode
"you want kernel1 to do only the multiplicaiton part in that example" ~ k
"Right, kinda" ~ ConsciousCode
"There should only be 1 kernel technically, which does the jobs of both kernel0 and kernel1" ~ ConsciousCode
"that's exactly what your first kernel0 does" ~ k
"I don't seem to grasp where the problem lies; you can't generate a code like that for some reason?" ~ k
"Well, it's because linear algebra makes everything harder" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have to represent expressions like (Wx + b)y" ~ ConsciousCode
"That requires two kernels" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which on its own even is fine" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then I might need Wx + b AND (Wx + b)y" ~ ConsciousCode
"At that point I'm getting confused about how to do it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because I only know what values I need by the references to the DAG at the start of compilation" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't know the reason why does it require two kernels or how are they chained to compute the final value; I understand your DAG has a node for Wx+b and another for (Wx+b)y which, I guess, is adjacent to it" ~ k
"It requires two kernels because W.x has to be totally done before its result can be used with y" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's easiest to just put that into two kernels and run them in sequence, effectively synchronizing between them" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not to mention W.x has a different thread count requirement" ~ ConsciousCode
"so when you run them in order, isn't the immediate value exactly what you want? don't you have it somewhere?" ~ k
"It's just one possible value I'll want" ~ ConsciousCode
"Flux can't know what I want until I tell it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could want just W.x instead of W.x + b" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or W.x + b when the total is tanh(W.x + b)" ~ ConsciousCode
"ok, then, so when you compile it down, you need to know that you want that value out and write it to the output, or is there something more to it?" ~ k
"Yeah, basically" ~ ConsciousCode
"can you write that kernel0 as somethihng like tmp0=in[0][id]+3; tmp1=tmp0*9; out[0][id]=tmp0; out[1][id]=tmp1; or you can't because matrices or whatever?" ~ k
"I can do that, OpenCL will probably optimize it out" ~ ConsciousCode
"because if you can then it doesn't really sounds hard, maybe I'm missing something, but given pointers to nodes in your DAG, you just get all the nodes that outputs collectively depend on, topologically sort them, and write out them as is" ~ k
"except probably having to do it in more than one kernel spolis that plan" ~ k
"There's probably ways to bruteforce it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just want a clear pattern that makes the result obivous" ~ ConsciousCode
"Begone spaghetticode" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh k, think I thought of something" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I have the DAG abstractions" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I need to translate those into a list of lists of kernels (for parallelization)" ~ ConsciousCode
"So what I should do is have a Partial abstraction representing the partially-constructed program and a Kernel abstraction representing kernels" ~ ConsciousCode
"The Partial is fed the DAG front to back, and it builds kernels as it goes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Once it reaches a point where it can't continue to add stuff to a kernel, it cuts it off and starts a new one" ~ ConsciousCode
"It can keep track of which parts of the DAG are to be outputted and check them off if they've already been compiled" ~ ConsciousCode

"<EnKrypt> Stuff that you wouldn't normally experience in a classroom" ~ EnKrypt

"<ConsciousCode> Where does it get money?" ~ EnKrypt
"<EnKrypt> It's still in a very very early stage, but all my friends are on board with organizing, and I know a lot of people who've said that they'd like to be a member." ~ EnKrypt

"Unless you were actively looking for jobs or cared about the repurcussions of having a bad portfolio, I guess it's ok to not care" ~ EnKrypt
"https://github.com/ConsciousCode/Espresso" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ignore string.* for now, they're better suited for later implementations" ~ ConsciousCode
"For now we can use a really simple block string implementation, e.g. just use malloc and realloc" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hm, I've done less work than I thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh wait woh" ~ ConsciousCode
"EnKrypt I just realized" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't need the { ... } syntax" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can do the much stranger ( ... ) syntax" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. for(...) ( x; y; z;)" ~ ConsciousCode
"(...) will have multiple meaning then" ~ EnKrypt
"No it won't" ~ ConsciousCode
"(...) just indicates a divisible atom" ~ ConsciousCode
"An expression" ~ ConsciousCode
"; separates computation like , does in C and JS" ~ ConsciousCode
"So (x; y; z;) runs x, y, and z and then returns z" ~ ConsciousCode
"function params?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, in JS (1, 2, 3) == 3" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's mostly used for minifiers" ~ ConsciousCode
"This syntax is already implicit in the definition" ~ ConsciousCode
"So technically having { ... } too is redundant" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe when I read the spec it'll make more sense." ~ EnKrypt
"Think it'll dissuade too many people?" ~ ConsciousCode
"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F4KNbGQ91aVG0hWsg611AfqtBy-iJgty-5px_Wcevq4/edit" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk how descriptive this is" ~ ConsciousCode
"yield is similar to pass" ~ EnKrypt
"In how you would use it" ~ EnKrypt
"No what language, Python?" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, it's used for generators" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. def integers(): x = 0; while 1: yield x" ~ ConsciousCode
"This'll generate an infinite list of integers, er" ~ ConsciousCode
"def integers(): x = 0; while 1: yield x; x += 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"So like return?" ~ EnKrypt
"Can I shove that as a list comprehension?" ~ EnKrypt
"Though not in Python" ~ ConsciousCode
"You have to use def to use yield" ~ ConsciousCode
"In Espresso, though, list comprehensions are a little bit funkier" ~ ConsciousCode
"All control flow operators are themselves expressions" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though they self-evaluate if not used as expressions" ~ ConsciousCode
"So for instance, that same integers generator can be expressed as:" ~ ConsciousCode
"for(var x = 0; ; x += 1) x" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you treat that as an expression, it returns an iterator, e.g.:" ~ ConsciousCode
"for(var y in (for(var x = 0; ; x += 1) x)) ( ... )" ~ ConsciousCode
"Umm, I'm not sure what an iterator is." ~ EnKrypt
"You know what iteration is, right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"An iterator is an object which encapsulates iteration" ~ ConsciousCode
"So for instance, you can get an iterator for a vector in C++" ~ ConsciousCode
"That pretends it's a pointer" ~ ConsciousCode
"So ++it moves it forward by one" ~ ConsciousCode
"And *it returns the value of the vector at the current position" ~ ConsciousCode
"In a sense, for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) i is an iterator in this expression" ~ ConsciousCode
"/in a sense/" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's not a "real" iterator because it doesn't know what it's iterating over, unless you want to think of it as an iterator over the range [0, n)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hmm, so it's just a representation of the iteration happening?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm guessing the object and what you can do with it depends on the language?" ~ EnKrypt
"So in for(var x in y), y gives the for loop an iterator and that iterator iterates over y and returns values for x" ~ ConsciousCode
"the iterator object" ~ EnKrypt
"Scripty languages don't have nearly as many limitations" ~ ConsciousCode
""Espresso is an attempt at an embeddable C-like with heavy emphasis..."" ~ EnKrypt
"Did you miss a noun?" ~ EnKrypt
"C-like is a noun" ~ ConsciousCode
"In this usage" ~ ConsciousCode
"C-like what? XD" ~ EnKrypt
"So put that there? :P" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you really use it as a noun?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's a doughnut-like object" ~ EnKrypt
"doughnut-like - adjective" ~ EnKrypt
"object - noun" ~ EnKrypt
"Lol seriously though. Is that really a thing?" ~ EnKrypt
"Sure, I see it often enough in language discussions" ~ ConsciousCode
"The "language" is just implicit because nothing else would qualify as "C-like"" ~ ConsciousCode
"C-like syntax" ~ EnKrypt
"C-like compiler" ~ EnKrypt
"C-like operator" ~ EnKrypt
"Those are much less common though, and C-like syntax and compiler are effectively the same as language" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok so walk me through this. How would you even start to build a language?" ~ EnKrypt
"Build a parser to translate your stuff to native stuff" ~ EnKrypt
"You start by evaluating the AST directly" ~ ConsciousCode
"Abstract Syntax Tree" ~ ConsciousCode
"So a + b*c would be +(a, *(b, c))" ~ ConsciousCode
"So first parse to AST?" ~ EnKrypt
"Is AST its own topic by itself?" ~ EnKrypt
"Maybe I need to read up on that first" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah but it's not too hard to wrap your head around" ~ ConsciousCode
"What you've done is prefix" ~ EnKrypt
"It's just a hierarchical representation of the structure of the syntax" ~ ConsciousCode
"Wow, I didn't know I needed this" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, parsing numerical numbers seem easy." ~ EnKrypt
"How would I do something like if statements?" ~ EnKrypt
"If becomes a node in itself?" ~ EnKrypt
"Just convert it to its component parameters" ~ ConsciousCode
"if(cond, then, else)\" ~ ConsciousCode
"With leaves representing the different paths?" ~ EnKrypt
"Umm, I'm thinking in terms of an actual tree." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, what's the purpose of each leaf? To represent level of execution?" ~ EnKrypt
"You just need to have the semantics" ~ ConsciousCode
"If in that case is a tree with 3 branches" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, so order of evaluation too." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, ASTs make order of operations non-ambiguous" ~ ConsciousCode
"Alright, I'll give this a shot in the morning" ~ EnKrypt
"Will Espresso be entirely in C?" ~ EnKrypt
"C is just the easiest to write bindings for, since so many languages can bind to it and it's not allowed to mangle names" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why? Getting cold feet?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, I don't blame you. It's my go to solution for low level stuff too" ~ EnKrypt
"C and I just don't get along very well" ~ EnKrypt
"It'll grow on you" ~ ConsciousCode
"The worst part about C is having to implement common patterns every time because it doesn't have generics" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you get used to it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Dude, I remember making a program to generate rainbow tables." ~ EnKrypt
"I actually like programming in its specific syntax because it really forces you to consider what you're doing" ~ ConsciousCode
"I still have nightmares about string handling in C sometimes." ~ EnKrypt
"Like, in Java you can have a bunch of types that all have a base type" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you can't *really* do that in C, so you have to make something like a class pattern, which is generally better" ~ ConsciousCode
"Don't forget that C libraries are really easy to bind to" ~ ConsciousCode
"So a string manipulation library would be easy to use" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's true and all, but low level isn't really my thing." ~ EnKrypt
"Maybe starting out with a language was a bad idea." ~ EnKrypt
"There's also the C bindings for Snow :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah saw that." ~ EnKrypt
"But it's primarily for js no?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's cross-language" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also the github is really out of date" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have the C bindings like 75% done now IIRC" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now I know why people start with C as their first language." ~ EnKrypt
"Once you get used to something else, it's really hard to go to C unless you're doing something that absolutely requires it." ~ EnKrypt
"It's one of the simplest and gives you a firm foundation in how computers work under the hood without having to go to assembly" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's apparently easy to transition from C to another language. But not from another language to C" ~ EnKrypt
"Maybe you should force yourself to do a C project to get that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Scared me away tbh :P" ~ EnKrypt
"Can't quit, gotta keep going" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or just never do anything low level" ~ EnKrypt
"You lack foundations without C" ~ ConsciousCode
"Meh. It's not like my ambitions involve building drivers or an OS." ~ EnKrypt
"It's a really valuable perspective to have even in high level languages" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is the effort to reward balance really worth it? Doesn't look like it from here :P" ~ EnKrypt
"You're right though. I think Ill have to get used to C eventually." ~ EnKrypt
"Some stingy people would say you aren't a real programmer if you can't do C" ~ ConsciousCode
"It gives you a perspective into how your computer works" ~ ConsciousCode
"No true Scottsman fallacy" ~ EnKrypt
"Anyway whatever" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is like explaining to a high school graduate why math is an important perspective to learn" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not for the number crunching but the modality of thought which enables mathematical and rational thinking to begin with" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whoa there. C is not the same as something so abstract." ~ EnKrypt
"I code mainly in loosely typed languages with my primary OS being Windows. I think I've strain far away from the acceptable standards." ~ EnKrypt
"No, but C is close enough to the abstraction of computation that it makes an incredible guide to having that perspective" ~ ConsciousCode
"Computation is the mathematical perspective, C is the algebra and trig you learn, the number crunching" ~ ConsciousCode
"That isn't specific to C." ~ EnKrypt
"And the parts that are, aren't the majority." ~ EnKrypt
"No but C is the best for that that I know of" ~ ConsciousCode
"C encourages exploration into low level representations of computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"But low level isn't my field, yet." ~ EnKrypt
"You're thinking of this wrong" ~ ConsciousCode
"I get it though. I will probably have to deal with it sooner or later." ~ EnKrypt
"It isn't teaching low level" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's teaching computation at a base level" ~ ConsciousCode
"What pointers are, word alignment, how a computer /works/" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's ALWAYS valuable no matter how high level you get" ~ ConsciousCode
"Every language can be expressed in some way in C'" ~ ConsciousCode
"Most of which I'm familiar with from my experience with other languages" ~ EnKrypt
"Java makes objects into pointers with a single base type" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that low level understanding of what goes under the hood helps you grasp the higher level concepts on a deeper level" ~ ConsciousCode
"M8 I don't dislike C as a language itself. I dislike the amount of effort it takes to get work done." ~ EnKrypt
"You look at Java objects and say "Oh I know how this'd work in C"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh well I'm done preaching" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe k will be on to lecture you about how Lisp is even better" ~ ConsciousCode
"See, I love lisp." ~ EnKrypt
"At least it's syntax is intuitive." ~ EnKrypt
"Inb4 I'm a heathen for disliking C and using Winblows." ~ EnKrypt
"One day those things will change." ~ EnKrypt
"C is basically a high level assembler, every statement can be directly expressed as machine code, no hidden bullshit going under the hood unlike in higher level languages (C++ is not C); and learning C makes you develop pretty good intuition about usage of resources that people comming from very high level languages like python or whatever severely lack" ~ k
"most of the "accidentially quadratic" stuff happens because the lack of this intuition" ~ k
"k am I a real programmeR?" ~ ConsciousCode
"My parents don't believe me because I have very few demonstrable projects because of depression and motivation" ~ ConsciousCode
""real programmer" is such a loaded term" ~ k
"My parents don't seem to think I know as much as I think I do" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which I interpret as "he isn't a real programmer"" ~ ConsciousCode
"K I need help with redundant error correction codes if you know how to do those" ~ ConsciousCode
"which kind?" ~ k
"I'm going to hook up a bunch of PICs as asynchronous processors" ~ ConsciousCode
"They depend on the "last" PIC's output, which is a bitstream" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I don't trust the PIC clocks to be exactly aligned" ~ ConsciousCode
"If a PIC's sampling is slightly faster than the stream, it'll skip bits every once in a while" ~ ConsciousCode
"And if it's slightly slower, it'll repeat bits" ~ ConsciousCode
"Both are disastrous as they destroy the data" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the goal is to insert some kind of bit error correction which can handle single deletions and insertions" ~ ConsciousCode
"For our purposes we can assume that the actual stream's error rate is 0% and all errors occur by clock differences" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that neither error can be followed by another error" ~ ConsciousCode
"I see, I'm more familiar with channels flipping bits, not insertion/deletion" ~ k
"but can't you get them synced in the first place? at least for communication?" ~ k
"Do you know how?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm pretty sure PICs are single-threaded, and I have to be running 3 processes each" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I'm worried that my processing may take up too much time for the input sampling and miss bits" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or that I'll overcompensate in the output waveform code and it'll repeat digits" ~ ConsciousCode
"My processing model is like factorio, if you've ever played it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically each PIC has an input and output stack which'll have 3 entries or so" ~ ConsciousCode
"Inputs are only transmitted when a request for input bit is on" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the request for input is only sent when the input stack isn't full" ~ ConsciousCode
"This lets each process manage its processing and resources independently" ~ ConsciousCode
"okay, but how are communications actually done?" ~ k
"The I/O ports of the PICs, which are explicitly sampled" ~ ConsciousCode
"The O of one leads to the I of the other" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't do a rising-edge callback or something if that's what you mean" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe if I have it request each bit separately..?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then there's no ambiguity which bit is which" ~ ConsciousCode
"That'll have some pretty bad latency though, so maybe I should try making a legit bus" ~ ConsciousCode
"Only between adjacent units though" ~ ConsciousCode
"if you can get interrupts on edges then you could use some kind of self-clocking code (Manchester? idk) and synchronize it in software" ~ k
"Oh shoot, I forgot about interrupts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Wow I'm a dummy, that's exactly what's needed" ~ ConsciousCode
"Apparently UART already has this covered" ~ ConsciousCode
"Pi, dp you know where I could learn more about p2p and blockchains?" ~ EnKrypt
"I just had an idea for a decentralized compression scheme, but I need to know all the variables before I roll it around in my head further." ~ EnKrypt
"Uhh, no not really" ~ ConsciousCode
"Try the whitepapers of the various altcoins" ~ ConsciousCode
"Pst EnKrypt, still awake?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just went to the most amazing grocery store" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol tell me more." ~ EnKrypt
"It's called Aldi's, it's a German company that has prices half that of Walmart because they reduce the number of brands they sell" ~ ConsciousCode
"So that isle of 10,000,000 beans? It's now a crate of beans" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well, pinto beans anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"They don't bother buying from a billion companies with the same product" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that lowers costs" ~ ConsciousCode
"They also pay their workers more, which makes it so they can stretch what workers they have thinner" ~ ConsciousCode
"Walmart needs tons of employees because they don't care" ~ ConsciousCode
"So they each need to be given 1 task and 1 task alone" ~ ConsciousCode
"At $12/hr, these guys have a go-getter attitude where they do more than one thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why is this amazing? Well I had a fantastic idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"For context, do you know about the employeeless coffee shop?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Uhh no, how does that work?" ~ EnKrypt
"Like a vending machine thing" ~ EnKrypt
"All the coffee and coffee accessories are out and about for customers to make it how they want" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like open on the counter?" ~ EnKrypt
"And there's a locked box in the store where they're supposed to put the amount that the menu says it costs" ~ ConsciousCode
"And everyone just "behaves"?" ~ EnKrypt
"Our current social paradigm would predict them to suffer a massive loss" ~ ConsciousCode
"But amazingly, people tended to pay /more/ than the menu said on average" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think this is because of a fairly simple principle;" ~ ConsciousCode
"People's decisions are primarily informed by what's most convenient for them" ~ ConsciousCode
"It may SEEM convenient to just steal the coffee" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then you have to juggle the guilt and the understanding that you can't rationally consider yourself a good person" ~ ConsciousCode
"So people pay" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think this is part of why self-checkout lines work too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Those have safety mechanisms in place though" ~ EnKrypt
"Since if people were all rational actors, you'd expect them to fail completely as people pretend to use them and then just walk away" ~ ConsciousCode
"You walk out and those alarms go off right?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm sure there's one way or another to trick it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it's too inconvenient to try :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, that was what I was going to say" ~ EnKrypt
"This is also why piracy is such a big issu" ~ ConsciousCode
"People are REMOVED from the understanding that they are, in some sense, "stealing" from the company because of several layers of abstractions" ~ ConsciousCode
"And they have lazy justifications like "they make money anyway"" ~ ConsciousCode
"One absolutely brilliant counter-example, though, was when Mojang released a pirated copy of Minecraft that was 100% the same, but had a message in the corner saying something like "Why didn't you buy this game? :c"" ~ ConsciousCode
"At least for me, this made me so guilty and ashamed of showing people that I was playing it, so I eventually bought it" ~ ConsciousCode
"There are people though who'd rather hack out the message than pay for it" ~ EnKrypt
"Right, but those aren't the majority" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're like the 1 percentil" ~ ConsciousCode
"*percentile" ~ ConsciousCode
"The majority pirate because buying is the convenient option." ~ EnKrypt
"Right, because of those layers of abstraction" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not just that. It's either blocked in their country" ~ EnKrypt
"Or too expensive" ~ EnKrypt
"But the message directly confronts them with the reality that they're indirectly hurting the creators of a game they like" ~ ConsciousCode
"So from this we can conclude that in a system of humans, we can assume that the vast majority will follow rules you give them provided those rules are more convenient, accounting for mental heuristics like ethics" ~ ConsciousCode
"And this is a HUUUUUUGE butt" ~ ConsciousCode
"You CANNOT make it possible for an individual to break the system" ~ ConsciousCode
"If the box in the coffee shop wasn't locked, someone could steal the money" ~ ConsciousCode
"Destroying the collective effort of hundreds for the benefit of one" ~ ConsciousCode
"It is still possible to steal the money tbh, just then it becomes more inconvenient than not doing it." ~ EnKrypt
"Right, but it's also possible to steal money from a bank" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think the system should be brakable. But with precautionary safety measure that make the act of breaking a tedious task" ~ EnKrypt
"It's just much less convenient than other ways" ~ ConsciousCode
"All locked doors do is reduce people's desire to try" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, so if we're clear on that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe even if you're a little iffy on the practicality aspect" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just assume it as a premise" ~ ConsciousCode
"Aldi's gave me the grand idea for an employeeless grocery store" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is kind of brilliant because, if I can adjust the incentive system properly, it'd be marginally profitable, cheaper than even Aldi's, and give an out for homeless/starving people" ~ ConsciousCode
"Who would then, on average, pay back into the system more than they took out of guilt if they get out of poverty" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lmao, you'd let people steal things?" ~ EnKrypt
"And bring them back by guilt?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or did I misunderstand?" ~ EnKrypt
"There's nothing I could do, technically, except have the automated system give them a sad face and tell them that they're hurting everyone" ~ ConsciousCode
"I consider feeding the homeless to be more valuable than whatever it is that they would take" ~ ConsciousCode
"It just happens to have gift economy benefits" ~ ConsciousCode
"So, I'm going to do a bunch of research into grocery stores to see how I might do this, then take it to kickstarter" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol are you trying to tackle a problem based on human behaviour like a normal logical problem?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, because logic can tackle all problems given the right abstractions" ~ ConsciousCode
"It doesn't really matter if I waste the money because presumably, the kickstarter people will know it's a risky venture" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I have no personal investment in it, beyond my own desires" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not sure you've the right level of abstraction. You'd be surprised how shameless people can be. And making the homeless feel guilty in a way sounds harsh too. Might as well have a guilt free section for them they can pick out of." ~ EnKrypt
"Imo guilt tripping isn't a big enough barrier for people to feel it's the more inconvient option" ~ EnKrypt
"Lol, well initially at least this'll primarily be in rich neighborhoods" ~ ConsciousCode
""Rich", not slums basically" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because then much more people are buying than stealing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Rich people can be cheap too m8" ~ EnKrypt
"People in the middle class tend to feel they're above petty theft" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I know" ~ ConsciousCode
"But again, social experiment" ~ ConsciousCode
"I lose nothing" ~ ConsciousCode
"At least if I can get the kickstarter working" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's not just guilt, either" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want to make this place feel warm and welcoming" ~ ConsciousCode
"A place that's fun to be and promotes a message people believe in" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm too cynical to believe that we live in a perfect enough world for this to work without trouble." ~ EnKrypt
"And that's why I feel it's an experiment that needs to be tried" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's the predominant attitude of society, and I feel it's misguided" ~ ConsciousCode
"Founded in a distrust of everyone" ~ ConsciousCode
"Machiavellian instincts are almost evolutionary." ~ EnKrypt
"And imo, I too people are good. Individually." ~ EnKrypt
"But in a group, the hivemind can be pretty circlejerkish" ~ EnKrypt
"There's no hivemind here, though" ~ ConsciousCode
"In a community, there usually is. Bystander effect is an example." ~ EnKrypt
"Not a conscious hivemind with active results." ~ EnKrypt
"But a more passive one that everyone unknoeingly participates in" ~ EnKrypt
"Would you want to help me if I got the ball rolling?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, sure why not." ~ EnKrypt
"I can hear the eyeroll" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll help you lol, I just don't think it'll work :P" ~ EnKrypt
"But I'd rather help you try and be proven wrong than just keep that assumption and do nothing." ~ EnKrypt
"That's good" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think it's pretty clear that I won't ever accomplish anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which isn't itself bad, you don't need to solve the world to have worth or happiness" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it feels like I'm a waste of thought because I have all these ideas to try but lack any motivation to act" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everyone has their role lol. Some people come up with neat shit. Others get things done." ~ EnKrypt
"And some do neither" ~ ConsciousCode
"Find someone with the motivation to carry out your nice ideas." ~ EnKrypt
"No one cares" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have no real friends" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I think it says something that I don't ever finish any of my projects" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm clearly not a real programmer" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everything I think up is nonsense from the insane ramblings of an arrogant leech" ~ ConsciousCode
""real" - implying life isn't about compromising what it means to have relationships and people you trust as a way to make yourself feel better for your brief time staying alive." ~ EnKrypt
"You like being in your head more than making those things a reality." ~ EnKrypt
"Just find someone who likes the converse." ~ EnKrypt
"And that's the worst offense I can give" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everyone either doesn't want to talk/help or doesn't know enough to even contribute" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm going to take a guess and say the pool you're basing this assumption off of is meaninglessly small." ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, but those are the people I know" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't make friends, EnKrypt" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've never made friends all my life" ~ ConsciousCode
"They always find me" ~ ConsciousCode
"And now I'm not in a place where anyone can find me" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's a problem only if you have this insane standard for what a "friend" should be." ~ EnKrypt
"You don't need to have things in common with them even" ~ EnKrypt
"Then what's the point of conversing with them?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Someone would say it would be to have someone relatable by your side." ~ EnKrypt
"Make your time before you die a little less miserable." ~ EnKrypt
"I've watched videos claiming that aging may be curable in 20 years" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol you're talking like other people have a fuckton of friends everywhere who have everything in common with them." ~ EnKrypt
"Also >singularity" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't really feel depressed enough to kill myself" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I guess I just have to buckle down and continue being a miserable leech until post scarcity is a thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Doesn't matter if you won't die. You've evolved under that assumption. So a lot of your biological compulsions like wanting friends, or kids even which are common to pretty much all humans are based off of that." ~ EnKrypt
"Or else die in a car crash, either way is fine" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I don't have friends because I'm not a good or likable person" ~ ConsciousCode
"Would you be your friend?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, I think that's a category error" ~ ConsciousCode
"Dude I've known completely horrible shitstains have their own pile of shitstain flock." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm going to say something you told me once before :" ~ EnKrypt
"Give people a chance." ~ EnKrypt
"when did I say that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk long time back when I told you everyone in my school was retarded, i didn't like anyone and they had nothing in common with me." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm not rejecting people for being "too stupid" or something though" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just don't ever meet people" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's usually solved by having responsibilities that have you get out of your house." ~ EnKrypt
"Like college or work" ~ EnKrypt
"My experience of college has been one of essentially lighting money on fire" ~ ConsciousCode
"Time to make money then" ~ EnKrypt
"I've destroyed my GPA by now and no longer have the dependent scholarship to make it mostly free" ~ ConsciousCode
"Eh, the majority startups out there don't care if you have a degree." ~ EnKrypt
"I can't really explain it to you" ~ ConsciousCode
"You've tried before" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm unemployable" ~ ConsciousCode
"College dropout with a piss poor portfolio" ~ ConsciousCode
"Talentless failure" ~ ConsciousCode
"If companies here don't care if you have a degree, they won't care there either." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, imagine I'm your boss" ~ EnKrypt
"And I don't know where to look in the first place because all these magic startups seem to be totally absent" ~ ConsciousCode
"How would you be a pain rather than an asset?" ~ EnKrypt
"Dude you need a college degree to work at McDonalds these days" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm pretty sure that's bullshit. Given how college is retardedly expensive where you're from." ~ EnKrypt
"It's basic economics" ~ ConsciousCode
"Most people just want to see that you atleast have your high school diploma" ~ EnKrypt
"Society has made a college degree out to be absolutely essential" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the demand for it skyrockets" ~ ConsciousCode
"This means colleges can charge exorbitant fees because they know people will pay them regardless" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also as far as being an asset goes" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm pretty sure at my last job (which my dad gave me as head of his department) that I made work more difficult for others" ~ ConsciousCode
"Meaning I actually did negative work" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think head of a department is a good place to start" ~ EnKrypt
"No, he was head of the department" ~ ConsciousCode
"So full blown nepotism" ~ ConsciousCode
"I got a job as a student worker" ~ ConsciousCode
"I fucked things up so often that my boss put me on secretary duty, basically answering and redirecting phone calls" ~ ConsciousCode
"So someone gave you directions, and you just had to get that stuff done, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"And then I was fired for coming in late basically every day and being generally useless" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sounds more like you didn't like your job." ~ EnKrypt
"What did you have to do as a student worker?" ~ EnKrypt
"That wasn't really it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just slept in" ~ ConsciousCode
"I freaked out when I was late and would run" ~ ConsciousCode
"Moving boxes, paperwork, manual scantron correction, and data entry" ~ ConsciousCode
"That sounds like labor." ~ EnKrypt
"Yes basically" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm pretty sure that wasn't something you enjoyed doing" ~ EnKrypt
"And I was too worthless to do even that" ~ ConsciousCode
""even that", implies that this would be lower effort than something more creative." ~ EnKrypt
"Sometimes it takes more effort to do things you don't like" ~ EnKrypt
"I want a programming job" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it seems clear to me that I'd be fucking atrocious at it" ~ ConsciousCode
"By the other programming jobs you've had?" ~ EnKrypt
"By the fact that I've never done a single goddamned thing with my programming "ability"" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm all talk and can't do anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"I pretend to be smart so people think I am" ~ ConsciousCode
"And somehow it works, because I've learned enough technobabble" ~ ConsciousCode
"You're in good luck because that's pretty all you need to pass the interview" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, let's be honest here. You're a better programmer than I am. If I can get a easy job, it shouldn't be as hard for you." ~ EnKrypt
"why the hell would you think that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe you need a little push." ~ EnKrypt
"You've actually written code" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm seeing an expensive psychiatric doctor to try to diagnose my stupidity" ~ ConsciousCode
"My parents are throwing away hundreds of dollars every week just to figure out why I'm such a failure" ~ ConsciousCode
">try to do something i don't like" ~ EnKrypt
">can't do it because i don't like it" ~ EnKrypt
"This is memeworthy" ~ EnKrypt
"You're ignoring all the other stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"College dropout, nearly failed high school, no portfolio to speak of, 0 experience" ~ ConsciousCode
"Apart from the fact that I'm still in college, the rest applies to me as well." ~ EnKrypt
"If you manage to hold on to a job for 6 months even before getting fired or whatever else you think will happen, you can put that as experience on your resume" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm not convinced you have Imposter syndrome because you're actually a decent programmer" ~ EnKrypt
"Why do you think that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because I've worked with "programmers"." ~ EnKrypt
"So I have a baseline to compare your work to." ~ EnKrypt
"I've done nothing with my life" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, here's another thing. When you have a job to keep your mind occupied, you won't have the time to wallow in self pity as much." ~ EnKrypt
"Because then I'd have ANYTHING to show that I'm not all of these things" ~ ConsciousCode
"It may be "self pity" but it's rationally founded" ~ ConsciousCode
"My parents know I'm not a real programmer" ~ ConsciousCode
""real programmer"" ~ EnKrypt
"My "talent" is like the paranormal" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe it exists, maybe it doesn't" ~ ConsciousCode
"Again, this is like a really bad no true scottsman fallacy" ~ EnKrypt
"But there sure as hell isn't evidence for it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll be searching forever" ~ ConsciousCode
"They see my output" ~ ConsciousCode
"I talk a big game and then do nothing" ~ ConsciousCode
"You've never had a job you like, how do you know that?" ~ EnKrypt
"Because I do nothing in my free time" ~ ConsciousCode
"All I have is my philosophy shit" ~ ConsciousCode
"What does that have to do with what I asked." ~ EnKrypt
"M8 you haven't even done the relevant trial and error." ~ EnKrypt
"I talk a big game and then do nothing in my free time" ~ ConsciousCode
"You basically don't even have a failed experience to learn from." ~ EnKrypt
"When presumably if I wasn't talking out of my ass I'd actually make somethingg" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't need a job to program" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's what they see" ~ ConsciousCode
"That I don't have anything for all the shit I say" ~ ConsciousCode
"Honestly, they don't need you to be creative right off the bat, just competent. Creativity is a plus." ~ EnKrypt
"Having a job helps because the commitment compels you to take it somewhat seriously, especially if you like doing it." ~ EnKrypt
"What am I to do now?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've realized that my AI takes too much computation and the only viable way to make it work is cluster computing" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I don't have that many computers" ~ ConsciousCode
"So that ship has sailed" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I don't feel like working on espresso" ~ ConsciousCode
"And youtube has nothing new" ~ ConsciousCode
"No pending to-do lists?" ~ EnKrypt
"Espresso is the only one I care about right now but I don't feel like it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also I've realized something coolo" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could make {} equivalent to () so it looks C-like" ~ ConsciousCode
"That way it'd be 100% self-consistent syntax wise" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I think you mentioned that the last time." ~ EnKrypt
"No that was a new idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"What I said before was that {} is redundant so I'd cut it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if(a)(b) else (c) doesn't look so nice" ~ ConsciousCode
"EnKrypt you should hire me" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll suck yer dick while writing code :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol I barely have enough funds to sustain myself." ~ EnKrypt
"It isn't really so bad dude. You don't have to overthink it or take it so seriously even." ~ EnKrypt
"Spam your resume in craigslist. Someone will call you for an interview." ~ EnKrypt
"Repeat until job." ~ EnKrypt
"It's pretty mindless and isn't that stressful if you don't put anything on line for it." ~ EnKrypt
"*at stake for it" ~ EnKrypt
"I also don't want to waste an employers money" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've already had a job where I felt like I was scamming them" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's actually normal tbh." ~ EnKrypt
"When you go from making no money, to making money for work that isn't making you sweat blood, it feels like something's wrong." ~ EnKrypt
"I mean like it felt like I wasn't doing nearly the work that he expected of me and he was just being nice continuing to pay me" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've gotten to existential boredom again" ~ ConsciousCode
"I was trying to entertain myself with AI for weeks now" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I've realized it's out of my control and now I don't feel like doing anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"Don't worry, you'll find something to obsess over soon." ~ EnKrypt
"Don't use self pity as an outlet in the interim though." ~ EnKrypt
"Wanna help me brainstorm through this half baked idea I had?" ~ EnKrypt
"It was giving me a headache anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"So my understanding of p2p borders on nonexistant." ~ EnKrypt
"But I still this is possible." ~ EnKrypt
"You know how simple dictionary compression works right?" ~ EnKrypt
"Find repeating patterns, and sets up pointers for them to save space" ~ EnKrypt
"Is that a class of algorithms like lz-whatever?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not sure. Lz** probably does more on top of it" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah lzma and what not" ~ EnKrypt
"Anyway, what if we turned that dictionary into a blockchain thing?" ~ EnKrypt
"The compression algorithm gets more and more efficient the more it's used." ~ EnKrypt
"Space-wise but not time-wise" ~ ConsciousCode
"And there's not much network overhead as it's simple hash comparison for every pattern" ~ EnKrypt
"You think iterating through each pattern will be a pain?" ~ EnKrypt
"Lzw and friends usually have a special reset code because after a while it becomes too burdensome to consider all of the symbols" ~ ConsciousCode
"Afaik they go from decreasing order of size of patterns." ~ EnKrypt
"We could do the same" ~ EnKrypt
"It's diminishing returns" ~ ConsciousCode
"100 ms of processing gets less and less compression" ~ ConsciousCode
"When the size of pattern is lesser than a certain filesize, then yeah" ~ EnKrypt
"But what would the application of this be?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Super efficient compression?" ~ EnKrypt
" Based on real usage" ~ EnKrypt
"Of real people" ~ EnKrypt
"Another thing you have to consider is that compression is only useful over the same corpus of data" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can't really use universal symbols for all data types because then you'll essentially be making an expensive binary encoding" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. no compression" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even different files of the same type might not be able to properly utilize shared symbols" ~ ConsciousCode
"Base 128 seems like a good standard." ~ EnKrypt
"Since a real photo vs a screenshot in png will have drastically different patterns" ~ ConsciousCode
"I probably can't compress binary" ~ EnKrypt
"Hey you know since it's just doing hash comparisons, I could probably do binary too." ~ EnKrypt
"Does the computation for check if hash from file exists in hash in blockchain - happen on the blockchain or locally?" ~ EnKrypt
"It would be locally" ~ ConsciousCode
"In the ideal blockchain everyone has all of the blockchain's data" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hmm, then that too will be a factor if the blockchain is huge." ~ EnKrypt
"Obviously that isn't practical" ~ ConsciousCode
"So for instance bitcoin blockchain, almost no one has all of it" ~ ConsciousCode
"What part does each person have?" ~ EnKrypt
"Most clients just request the entire blockchain and verify that it's valid" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then keep the last few hundred blocks" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oooh. I could probably use the frequency of a certain hash being used to determine relevancy of that block being retained" ~ EnKrypt
"I have a feeling I'm slipping into territory where I have no clue what I'm talking about in regards to p2p" ~ EnKrypt
"It's more about compression" ~ ConsciousCode
"Universal compression can't really exist" ~ ConsciousCode
"The scheme you're proposing would more likely increase file sizes than decrease them" ~ ConsciousCode
"A good way to consider compression is entropy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Compression schemes turn low entropy data into high entropy data" ~ ConsciousCode
"That is, patterns are turned into more random bit patterns" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's a fundamental limit to how much entropy you can squeeze out" ~ ConsciousCode
"By combining all data together in your blockchain, you're reducing the entropy of the data-to-encode" ~ ConsciousCode
"So there's less and less that you can compress" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh, did I tell you about my idea for making circuits using conductive paint?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can probably try compressing each pattern to be added to the blockchain with the hashes in the blockchain before compressing it. That way the dictionary will still be high entropy." ~ EnKrypt
"No, what is it?" ~ EnKrypt
"Well, this is already a thing and there's a few instructables for it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But a few years ago I bought a bunch of metal powder for... reasons" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I've come to hate soldering, probably because I'm not doing it right" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I realized, I could more effectively make and test circuits using conductive paint" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is such a neat idea since it means ultra-small custom PCBs essentially" ~ ConsciousCode
"But things will.. fall off." ~ EnKrypt
"I guess for testing that's pretty neat" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm using acrylic paint as a base" ~ ConsciousCode
"Acrylic, if you don't know, is essentially plastic paint" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's really tough to get off" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have shirts which have had acrylic stains for years now" ~ ConsciousCode
"By "plastic paint" I mean it's a type of polymer that undergoes a chemical reaction to become plastic when exposed to air" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does it have more resistance as compared to plain solder?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah of course it will" ~ ConsciousCode
"Most tutorials use graphite, since it's an easy conductor to get" ~ ConsciousCode
"And those have somewhere around 100 ohms per inch of thick lines" ~ ConsciousCode
"Graphite is used in some homebrew resistors, so it's already at a disadvantage" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm using metal powders" ~ ConsciousCode
"Mixed in paint though" ~ EnKrypt
"So if there's breaks in the paint and it's not uniform" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, but they have much higher conductivity than graphite" ~ ConsciousCode
"Won't matter if there's no direct line of contact right?" ~ EnKrypt
"If there's a lump of acrylic in the middle or something" ~ EnKrypt
"I just have to make sure it's well mixed" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk if the mmixture will affect the conducting properties either." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm also trying to look into embedding some kind of electroluminescent material like phosphorous" ~ ConsciousCode
"So that when an electric current is flowing, it'll glow like magitech :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"You'd have to apply it artistically then for that to look nice." ~ EnKrypt
"A shining goop doesn't appeal that much :P" ~ EnKrypt
"Just imaging a glowing circuit board" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's basically what magitech looks like" ~ ConsciousCode
"All the research I've done says it needs a special layering setup and AC" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I can't just use it as a paint :c" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh apparently ZnS can do it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wonder if it'd work with having all the powders in the same medium" ~ ConsciousCode
"It'd be like having thousands of tiny EL panels" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then it'd still need an AC signal" ~ ConsciousCode
"I got it to work :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"Pi : Thought you should know that there's spam on parachan that's bordering on CP" ~ EnKrypt
"http://parachan.org/off/" ~ EnKrypt
"And possibly other boards too." ~ EnKrypt
"I should probably get rid of parachan honestly" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's only used for CP spam" ~ ConsciousCode
"Eh it's not like you're running out of hosting." ~ EnKrypt
"Leave it be for the little traffic that it gets" ~ EnKrypt
"It doesn't get traffic afaik" ~ ConsciousCode
"And is now a legal liability" ~ ConsciousCode
"And if you are running out DO credit, get github student pack." ~ EnKrypt
"I drop by like once a couple months" ~ EnKrypt
"Mostly lurk" ~ EnKrypt
"But you don't into paranormal" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I don't post." ~ EnKrypt
"I had my thing with the paranormal once too :P" ~ EnKrypt
"I just pretend it never happened." ~ EnKrypt
"Or at least happened irl" ~ EnKrypt
"That's irrational fam" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'd consider experiences not based on reality as irrational if you believe them." ~ EnKrypt
"That's oxymoronic" ~ ConsciousCode
"Thinking they were all some big hallucination is a safe bet." ~ EnKrypt
"All experiences are based in reality because experience = reality" ~ ConsciousCode
"Alright. And my theory is that it all happened in my head." ~ EnKrypt
"Which is plausible." ~ EnKrypt
"More plausible than the alternative" ~ EnKrypt
"That's not to say you have to accept paranormal interpretation x, y, and z" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just that you have to acknowledge that it happened" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sure, but not in this universe." ~ EnKrypt
"And hallucinations are an incredibly unlikely scenario given nothing about you is predisposed to that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just in my imagination" ~ EnKrypt
"<EnKrypt> More plausible than the alternative" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not proposing an alternative" ~ ConsciousCode
"Really? I've already told you I'm starting to believe I have some mental disorder or other" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm merely saying your theory doesn't hold water" ~ ConsciousCode
"And is thus irrational/unscientific" ~ ConsciousCode
"Might not fully hold water but it's at least wet. In comparison to the other theories I have." ~ EnKrypt
"I guess that train of logic justifies your atheism even though such a thing is fundamentally faith-based" ~ ConsciousCode
"You don't need to have an explanation for everything, especially not those which are lacking" ~ ConsciousCode
"Same way you don't have to have an opinion on everything" ~ ConsciousCode
"I disagree. I'm an *agnostic atheist*. I lack belief in the existence as well as non existence of gods. Which is pretty much what you mean by not having an opinion. It's just that position is also a flavor of atheism." ~ EnKrypt
"Fair enough. Hallucinations are my way of rationalizing it." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't really have an explanation for it." ~ EnKrypt
"Alright, then I take back that comparison" ~ ConsciousCode
"My concern is that by holding an irrational rationalization you're denying yourself possible alternative explanations, whatever those might be" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sperits aliens and whatnot is just as implausible" ~ ConsciousCode
"If not more so" ~ ConsciousCode
"Probably. But the options I have is one implausible explanation after another. Nothing that is consistent with my current understanding of reality. Which is pushing me to believe that this then must not have entirely been a part of reality as I know it." ~ EnKrypt
"Basically there is no null hypothesis here" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you have to take the extra leap of thought and refuse to commit to an explanation" ~ ConsciousCode
"It was a thing that happened, that's all you know" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess it doesn't matter as much as I'm making it out to" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's not actionable" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I've come to the realization that things which aren't actionable/don't affect you are a waste of thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. russell's teapot" ~ ConsciousCode
"You COULD think day in and day out about the teapot in the asteroid belt, but why would you?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Moreso I guess I'm harping on you about this because I have a massive boner for internal consistency and correctness" ~ ConsciousCode
"Intuition? You were probably using the teapot as a metaphor for some astrophysical concept you arrived at from some earlier train of thought." ~ EnKrypt
"I like my thoughts to be nearly mathematical :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol then my "experience" must really irk you because it has nothing of consistency." ~ EnKrypt
"Well then it's useful as a metaphor" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's self-consistent because there's nothing to contradict it :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"It has no connection to the rest of thought-space" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's just like a standalone thing which we know exists" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's consistent within its own universe." ~ EnKrypt
"And I mean internal consistency with regard to thoughts anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"Another fascinating thing to look at is "aliens"" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's one guy who's an adamant supporter of alternate theories" ~ ConsciousCode
"He claims the evidence is incontrovertible that UFO phenomena exists and defies known explanation" ~ ConsciousCode
"But also says that all proposed explanations are just as bad as hand waving them as natural phenomena" ~ ConsciousCode
"Aliens - why would they be here?" ~ ConsciousCode
"If they're taking biological samples they're doing a pretty piss poor job given it's taken them thousands of years" ~ ConsciousCode
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Vall%C3%A9e" ~ ConsciousCode
"Same thing with the fermi paradox actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"All the explanations are improbable to the extreme" ~ ConsciousCode
"Honestly the most likely explanation is probably that this is a simulation and it hasn't bothered making other life-filled places" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually, fermi paradox just suggests that intelligent civilizations have had to exist. That makes sense for it to to have existed in the past in a distant galaxy and no longer exists." ~ EnKrypt
"That ignores the fact that thousands of civilizations should have sprung up in the last few billion years" ~ ConsciousCode
"And should continue to spring up" ~ ConsciousCode
"And they're all dead after a certain point, or exist beyond our LoS" ~ EnKrypt
"The future-filter idea is nonsense because it assumes EVERY civilization in the entire galaxy eventually kills itself without exception" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is that so far fetched?" ~ EnKrypt
"What kind of phenomena would cause that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"You have to remember that this is thousands or even hundreds of thousands of civilizations" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does it matter? It looks like trial and error to me. Some naturally, others kill themselves, etc" ~ EnKrypt
"All totally alien to each other with totally different values and civilizations etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"And not a SINGLE one can have escaped or we'd see them, presumably" ~ ConsciousCode
"We're pretty closer to blowing up our planet too tbh" ~ EnKrypt
"Single one in the current time within our viewing distance" ~ EnKrypt
"That's what makes it feel plausible, but again these are aliens" ~ ConsciousCode
"They don't have the same values or even the same thought patterns we do" ~ ConsciousCode
"http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html" ~ ConsciousCode
"I like to think of it as like a rainbow table generator. Lots of planets are born, after a few iterations, one of them has life. Lots of planets with life will exist, one of them will be intelligent. Lots of intelligent civilizations will exist, few will make it past their galaxy." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah lmao seen that." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm not saying we're the ONLY ones to have come this far, but the fact that we have made it this far, just tells you that we're probably not going to make it to the next step by the overwhelming statistical odds against it." ~ EnKrypt
"Thousands, millions, billions of civilizations all eventually killing themselves without exception to me seems like flipping a coin and it landing on heads until the heat death of the universe" ~ ConsciousCode
"Only a few need to die out or kill themselves. The ones that would have existed in our current viewable field." ~ EnKrypt
"That's feasable to me." ~ EnKrypt
"Isn't that the entire milky way?" ~ ConsciousCode
"We can see stars on the other side" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh, did you get to the part about replication" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where just one hyper-advanced civilization could colonize the entire galaxy in a few million years?" ~ ConsciousCode
"For how long though? We don't even know the signs of a star having a planet with life on it. It's basically been less than a couple thousand years since we learned to look so far outside. Of course we don't see shit. That's like making a kid play basketball for the first time and expect him to shoot all 3 pointers." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah read the whole thing a long time back. Those are some neat theories." ~ EnKrypt
"I was obssessed with the fermi paradox." ~ EnKrypt
"Until I figured they didn't take time into account." ~ EnKrypt
"Time is a big component of it" ~ ConsciousCode
"They propose that 1000 civilizations apart from us should exist in the milky way *right now*, or in some hypothetical time in the past?" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, 100,000 apparently" ~ EnKrypt
"Still though. 13 billion years is enough for so many to have come and died out." ~ EnKrypt
"And it accounts for that" ~ ConsciousCode
"It doesn't assume every single one because a billion-year-old civilization" ~ ConsciousCode
"You are right, the most likely explanation is probably that we just don't have the tools to observe them" ~ ConsciousCode

"When did you get time travel again?" ~ ConsciousCode
"You mean when I supposedly would in the future?" ~ EnKrypt
"Details are very hazy, but I think it was around when I will be 20." ~ EnKrypt
"So a year or so from now." ~ EnKrypt
"Not much time" ~ ConsciousCode
"I must redouble my efforts into researching the gel banana to open steins gate! :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol you know, all it would take is future PiMaster to just time travel back and tell you how to do it." ~ EnKrypt
"I know that's disappointing because that means you never really discovered it from scratch." ~ EnKrypt
"But who knows, maybe you've broken the cycle." ~ EnKrypt
"Like I plan to do." ~ EnKrypt
"And it was always when you were 20?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Uhh, I kept going back and back, right? Those times I guess how old I was didn't matter, because I already knew how to go back." ~ EnKrypt
"But the initial stumbling across, was when I was 20 I guess." ~ EnKrypt
"And how did you know I told you?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't *know*. See, according to the experience, every time I go back, I basically forgot most things that happened in the timeline I came from except the things right in front of my head." ~ EnKrypt
"That would include things important to me, like why I went back, or how I went back." ~ EnKrypt
"I guess through all this jumping I still remembered the source of how I went back even I forgot that itself so I still could eventually discover it again." ~ EnKrypt
"*even though" ~ EnKrypt
"Keep in mind though, that by the end of it, I intentionally wanted to lose the ability to go back." ~ EnKrypt
"Or at least I didn't care anymore because I didn't plan to anyway." ~ EnKrypt
"So maybe my hunch that you'll lead me to it is misleading." ~ EnKrypt
"Well we'll know in a year if it's tru" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't understand why you used it at all though" ~ ConsciousCode

"Yeah but that's just it, I don't see things as needing to be "fixed"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even now as a college dropout leeching failure etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"I look back and say that I did exactly what I wanted to do in the moment and wouldn't change what I did because I hold the same basic values" ~ ConsciousCode
"But do you? What if your successes and failures made you a better person if they happened in a different set of circumstances?" ~ EnKrypt
"That's another thing too, my failures made me who I am now" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I like who I am now, almost by definition" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah, do you like you?" ~ EnKrypt
"I probably didn't :P" ~ EnKrypt
"Idk it's weird" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think I ever hated myself even when I was depressed" ~ ConsciousCode
"I like *me*, my personality and philosophy and values" ~ ConsciousCode
"The only flaws that can really be there are circumstantial" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like making mistakes in the past" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you have nothing else to compare to. The only person you've been is you." ~ EnKrypt
"So how could you hate yourself if you've never been someone else?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk, I guess I rationalized that being any combination of a different me would be better than the then me." ~ EnKrypt
"It's weird, but since I can't/don't want to go back anymore, I apply that philosophy to a lot of things. When I shifted to a different high school for my 11th and 12th grade, I pretended that I've already done all this before, and I was just reliving the entire thing again." ~ EnKrypt
"It's oddly liberating. Gives you more confidence, and makes you want to fuck around and have fun more." ~ EnKrypt

"Unless you explicitly factor fucking someone else over to meet your goals, you still "have honor"" ~ EnKrypt
"Not that kind of honor" ~ ConsciousCode
"More like... The  idea of your "pride being hurt"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is different from having pride in your work" ~ ConsciousCode
"Meh, that kind of pride is just some shallow social concept that exists as a more vanilla flavor of "shame"." ~ EnKrypt

"I tried trimming the sides of my hair." ~ EnKrypt_
"With a beard trimmer" ~ EnKrypt_
"Do you care about your hair?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I care about it looking at least passable." ~ EnKrypt_
"And given how I had unmaintainable hair most of my life, I like that it's getting easier to make it look good now." ~ EnKrypt_
"Like, if you had a particular hairstyle I can get regretting that" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I don't even brush my hair, it's just long and bushy" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if I wanted to experiment with that I'd start by cutting straight along and then clipping bits off so it doesn't look completely retarded" ~ ConsciousCode
"But see uniform long and bushy is ok." ~ EnKrypt_
"When parts of it stick out and weird ass angles, that's annoying." ~ EnKrypt_
"Though I live with neat freaks, so they beg me to let them pay for a hair cut when it's been a few months :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol. Getting a hair cut is kinda like hitting reset. Small hair can't look as bad as unmaintained long hair." ~ EnKrypt_
"How long do you mean by few months though?" ~ EnKrypt_

"Like I just came out of the woods screaming about solving fermat's last theorem" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol, that's oddly fitting." ~ EnKrypt_
"So EnKrypt here's an idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"With the advent of human intelligence, there's been an enormous evolutionary pressure put on animals to become smarter" ~ ConsciousCode
"And so we should expect that in a few thousand years animals will be orders of magnitude smarter, assuming no intervention" ~ ConsciousCode
"Watcha think?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think this is a globally consistent principle" ~ ConsciousCode
"Any sufficiently intelligent species will necessarily drive other species to become more intelligent, as they need to be able to adapt to their high variability" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. deer that get hit by cars don't breed as much, so deer gradually become smart enough to avoid roads" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or look both ways" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or not stand in place" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does evolution really move forward in that way though? It seems to me that it's just a series of convoluted trial and error (success being a favorable mutation), and we happened to get a good draw." ~ EnKrypt_
"It is, but I'm saying that any sufficiently advanced intelligent will have roughly the same impact that humans have" ~ ConsciousCode
"For another species to be smart(er), it'd have to go through another iteration of trial and errors." ~ EnKrypt_
"We've single handedly caused a new mass extinction" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which ordinarily puts enormous evolutionary pressure on survivors to adapt" ~ ConsciousCode
"IIRC mass extinctions are usually followed by mass adaptation" ~ ConsciousCode
"But see, species *are* going extinct. It's not that other species adapt as a result, they just get weeded out of the pool of species that no longer exist." ~ EnKrypt_
"Yes, because they didn't adapt fast enough" ~ ConsciousCode
"And species that do exist do so as a function of being able to survive, out of which being smart may or may not be a factor." ~ EnKrypt_
"The species that persist are the ones smart enough to cope" ~ ConsciousCode
"When other species go extinct, there becomes a vacuum of resources" ~ ConsciousCode
"Population "explodes" because of a lack of predators or competitors" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or else they go extinct for being dependent on that species" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wouldn't call coping an effect of being smart." ~ EnKrypt_
"No, it isn't necessarily" ~ ConsciousCode
"But in the case of the anthropocene, that's very much the case I think" ~ ConsciousCode
"Being dumb, and being dumb enough to die are different imo" ~ EnKrypt_
"We change the environment waaaaay too fast for unintelligent animals to stick around" ~ ConsciousCode
"They need to be able to adapt quickly" ~ ConsciousCode
"See: raccoons" ~ ConsciousCode
"People have to put literal locks on their trash cans because any kind of latch mechanism is quickly solved by them" ~ ConsciousCode
"That proves they're smart, but there's really no way to know that if they weren't, they would've died out." ~ EnKrypt_
"Or if concern over dying out was even the reason for them getting smarter over time." ~ EnKrypt_
"Right, that isn't the case either" ~ ConsciousCode
"For all we know the smartest snail on the planet might've gone extinct as a result" ~ ConsciousCode
""Mao" ~ Gary" ~ EnKrypt_
"But the overall trend is that animals with little strong dependencies on dwindling resources (which survive the initial shock) and enough intelligence to cope with extremely rapid environmental changes (definition of intelligence), the second condition is what drives the animals that are able to evolve over time" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think that can be compared to the difference between someone who can solve fizzbuzz efficiently, and someone who can also solve it using a NN." ~ EnKrypt_
"With the problem at hand, the guy who writes the direct solution is going to get the most points because speed" ~ EnKrypt_
"My point is that the need to rapidly adapt is intelligent by definition, but not necessarily human-level" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the guy who can do it with a NN is basically also able to solve a multitude of other problems with his skill set" ~ EnKrypt_
"But if better adaptive ability lets you survive better, then your species will tend to become more adaptive" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think intelligence and survival are mutually exclusive. Kind of like the corelation-doesn't-imply-causation thingy." ~ EnKrypt_
"On the long run, intelligence does a lot of things really well." ~ EnKrypt_
"If that were the case humans wouldn't exist" ~ ConsciousCode
"We had to gain intelligence over millions of years" ~ ConsciousCode
"But given just one specific problem, another shortcut might overtake and prevail." ~ EnKrypt_
"Yeah, we took the long route." ~ EnKrypt_
"What would be the short route for, say, raccoons?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk what the favorable conditions are for trash pandas, but say for a species that evolved to camoflage, that ability would be a shortcut as opposed to taking millions of years getting smart and learning implementing stealth." ~ EnKrypt_
"Camoflage is useless if the environment keeps changing colors" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah, but until it does, you've got the lead." ~ EnKrypt_
"A lot of species have survived with that ability." ~ EnKrypt_
"Fuck changing colors, some static colored organisms can also camoflage by just color matching their environment, and it's worked for that specific problem." ~ EnKrypt_
"Whereas a species still halfway through becoming smart would get killed" ~ EnKrypt_
"Not to mention camoflage doesn't really help in a human-oriented world" ~ ConsciousCode
"We don't kill because we see something we don't like" ~ ConsciousCode
"We kill because they're stepped on" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that's because human oriented is based around intelligence" ~ EnKrypt_
"Or in this case, "not camoflage"" ~ EnKrypt_
"I mean nature being forced into contact with humanity" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wonder if intelligence is a short cut to some other evolutionary trait that gives a stronger abstraction." ~ EnKrypt_
"Wouldn't that just be more intelligence?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think humans are really that smart honestly" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not the way other people look at it anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think we're around the bare bones minimum intelligent to be sapient/rational" ~ ConsciousCode
"And we got that way through the repetition of exactly one brain pattern" ~ ConsciousCode
"The neocortex is the same pattern copypasted a million times" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah that sounds really limited." ~ EnKrypt_
"Like there could easily be something more" ~ EnKrypt_
"Some arbitrary next level that we can't comprehend because we haven't reached that far yet" ~ EnKrypt_
"Well look no further my son for the AI lords cometh B3" ~ ConsciousCode
"No that's kind of what I mean by "sapient/rational"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Our brains are capable of indefinite abstractions" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're just not good at it, if that makes sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's like... if we made a pencil out of a chunk of charcoal" ~ ConsciousCode
"One dimensional?" ~ EnKrypt_
"Yes it can draw a painting but a real pencil would be a lot easier" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's how I define sapience anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically turing-complete intelligence" ~ ConsciousCode
"Abstractions of arbitrary depth and complexity, provided external resources" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it still seems so limited" ~ EnKrypt_
"Oh we haven't caught up in a while have we?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need to tell you the good news about AI" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or even just the next decade" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lots of stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"So, first and foremost last year I predicted humanoid AI by the year 2020" ~ ConsciousCode
"By "humanoid AI", what I mean is if you took the general sense that you get from Siri + the ability to hold a conversation" ~ ConsciousCode
"That is, she isn't just a question-answer machine, she can think on the fly" ~ ConsciousCode
"But can't do so especially well" ~ ConsciousCode
"We can consider this minimal-sapience" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't want to make any predictions for AI after that until I see what 2020 is like, but I think Ray Kurzweil is right to predict singularity stuff by at the latest 2045" ~ ConsciousCode

"His only goal is to cure the stuff that makes old people miserable, basically" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which just so happens to have the side benefit of increasing longevity, as all medical advances do" ~ ConsciousCode
"But in this case it's curing the diseases associated with aging, so it's no longer a matter of wait-until-you-die but rather wait-until-you're-hit-by-a-truck" ~ ConsciousCode

"Human bodies are like cars" ~ ConsciousCode
"Cars don't just "stop working", there's always a specific reason for it" ~ ConsciousCode

"Remember that weirdo language I was thinking about making earlier?" ~ ConsciousCode
"The one where everything is immutable" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just realized that because I'm making everything an expression, semicolons can exist in expressions, and {} () are interchangeable, all of the control structures can be implemented as functions if I support auto-currying" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. function for(stuff, body) { stuff[0](); while(stuff[1]()) { body(); stuff[2](); } }" ~ ConsciousCode
"Something like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess there's some hand-waving there, and I need a way to delay execution" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which actually maybe should be {}" ~ ConsciousCode
"In which case the user version of for would be for{...} { ... }" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or alternatively for({...}) { ... }" ~ ConsciousCode
"This language is turning out to be like a pure functional lisp with C syntax" ~ ConsciousCode
"that actually sounds nice; maybe make everything lazy rather than delaying execution explicitly" ~ k
"or maybe not, it would make other things harder" ~ k
"Yeah idk how well that'd work" ~ ConsciousCode
"using {} to mean the function value rather than its result doesn't sound bad either so that's fine" ~ k
"Yeah {} would just be a parameterless function essentially" ~ ConsciousCode
"and "function" is a function (well, routine) that takes name and a body and declares new function? :)" ~ k
"that's starts smelling Tcl-ish ;p" ~ k
"No, it breaks the syntax because of the parameters list" ~ ConsciousCode
"It'd have to use some kind of macro system if I tried that" ~ ConsciousCode
"The primary goals of this language are simplistic and self-consistent syntax, a minimal base, but none of the issues that normally disable JIT optimizations" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. the scope itself is mutable (globals()['hello'] = 7), built-in types are extensible, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"Interesting note" ~ ConsciousCode
"if(x || return 0) { return 1; } is actually valid syntax" ~ ConsciousCode
"Although I'm thinking of using an or keyword instead of ||" ~ ConsciousCode
"K I think I dun goofed" ~ ConsciousCode
"What happened?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm trying to think through Espresso's semantics" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I realized that I didn't have an answer for how you'd operate on a directed graph within it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since objects are immutable and all you can change are references, changing just one thing would cause a massive update of the structure" ~ ConsciousCode
"And even then it wouldn't update the way you expect because it'd only update based on the name resolution you used" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. if A and B refer to C, if you change A.C.value, A.B.value will be unchanged" ~ ConsciousCode
"I know immutability is possible though because there's compiler IRs based on it..." ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh my god I'm a dummy" ~ ConsciousCode
"If A and B refer to C, how can you do A.C and A.B?" ~ EnKrypt
"I forgot that I allowed you to refer to the name itself rather than the value" ~ ConsciousCode
"A.C and B.C" ~ ConsciousCode
"But yeah it's actually fine because they can refer to the name rather than the value" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is equivalent to mutability" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which I think is a really interesting way to approach it though it might take some getting used to" ~ ConsciousCode
"See, @name makes an object that abstractly refers to a particular name/reference rather than its value" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if the name in the scope were to change its value, its value would change too" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it isn't actually mutable, it's still referring to the same thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I guess for now it's easiest to think of it as just "this value can change and I'm ok with that"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did I fry your brain? :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think you've explained this part of Espresso before though" ~ EnKrypt
"It's frying my brain a bit too" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I think this paradigm of programming has huge potential" ~ ConsciousCode
"It guarantees modularity and locality" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nothing will ever change unless you specifically tell it that you want to see the changes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Funnily enough this disables like 90% of OOP" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that's almost a good thing because it disables the shitty parts" ~ ConsciousCode
"The things that people implement that seem nice on the surface but are actually absolutely terrible for modularity or expansion" ~ ConsciousCode
"And it comes with a nice model too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Data is data" ~ ConsciousCode
"The number 12 will never, ever change" ~ ConsciousCode
"The structure representing an abstraction of cat will never change" ~ ConsciousCode
"Semantically though, 12 is still a label, which means it can vary across interpretations." ~ EnKrypt
"I mean, it probably won't. Because it's part of a standard." ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, but I'm talking about the value of 12" ~ ConsciousCode
"That intrinsic 12ness that we can only ever imply exists because anything else we use is a label by definition" ~ ConsciousCode
">yfw in Python there's ways to change the number 2 to a different number" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol really?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, they're hacks but they're still there" ~ ConsciousCode
"And IIRC Java had something similar awhile ago that might've been patchd" ~ ConsciousCode
"There was some way to abuse reflection to change the value of a string literal" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh that reminds me of a train of thought I had yesterday, but I wanted your opinion." ~ EnKrypt
"So I was thinking about Theseus' ship and what not from what we were talking about yesterday." ~ EnKrypt
"And how an object can only be guaranteed to be wholly that object in a given exact frame in time." ~ EnKrypt
"Kind of like d(composition of object)/dt" ~ EnKrypt
"And I came across this reddit post that said something like "We're really lucky that all the countries agreed on the same units of time"" ~ EnKrypt
"And I wondered, how did that happen?" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean sure, 1 second is measurably quantifiable." ~ EnKrypt
"But our experience of going through time. Why the fuck is it at a steady rate?" ~ EnKrypt
"It doesn't need to b" ~ ConsciousCode
"At any rate, it "feels" like it does." ~ EnKrypt
"Say you have some function f(t)" ~ ConsciousCode
"f(t) changes with time, obviously" ~ ConsciousCode
"And t presumably has some units" ~ ConsciousCode
"But what were to happen if you approximated f(t) by iterating over t in small increments?" ~ ConsciousCode
"And say "in actuality" you took centuries between each increment?" ~ ConsciousCode
"f(t) doesn't care how often and where it's sampled because it's f(t) by definition regardless of what t you're using" ~ ConsciousCode
"So time isn't going at a steady rate because such an idea is a categorical error" ~ ConsciousCode
"Time is the thing which drives our function "forward" but for all it cares it could be going backwards" ~ ConsciousCode
"Our experience has causality from lower t to higher t" ~ ConsciousCode
"So our experience is one of going forward in time" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that steadiness is based on internal clocks in our brains which change at a steady pace within f(t)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll bet that if you could be a bug that lives 2 weeks, they'd experience time a lot slower than we do" ~ ConsciousCode
"So every second is like a day to them" ~ ConsciousCode
"Exactly. F(t) doesn't care about t at all. You can use it however or wherever you want." ~ EnKrypt
"Which means, that "now" doesn't really exist." ~ EnKrypt
"Well it depends" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now as an objective measure, yes that doesn't exist" ~ ConsciousCode
"But now as a subjective experience, that does exist" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because you experience a now as the t at which your current thoughts are being defined" ~ ConsciousCode
"Doesn't mean anything else in the universe does too." ~ EnKrypt
"My now could be completely different from yours." ~ EnKrypt
"HELLO EVERYONE" ~ jamezq
"Our nows are incomparable" ~ ConsciousCode
"And omfg jq you're alive" ~ ConsciousCode
"Scared me there" ~ ConsciousCode
"Heard you got engaged. Congrats. When's the wedding?" ~ EnKrypt
"probably a yearish" ~ jamezq
"maybe in oregon, otherwise in california" ~ jamezq
"That's neat. I will be there in spirit." ~ EnKrypt
"What about in person" ~ jamezq
"where are you living right now" ~ jamezq
"Lol I wish. Same place as before." ~ EnKrypt
"But hey, who knows. I might be able to make it." ~ EnKrypt
"JQ what do you think of Espresso" ~ ConsciousCode
"That reminds me. I really need to get my passport soon." ~ EnKrypt
"The javascript language right?" ~ jamezq
"JS-y language" ~ ConsciousCode
"that wants to be python?" ~ jamezq
"It's JS-Lisp-Lua-Python with immutability as a guarantee" ~ ConsciousCode
"Look up a bit and you'll see me explaining this weird mutability paradigm" ~ ConsciousCode
"oh it's yours!" ~ jamezq
"I was thinking of coffeescript" ~ jamezq
"Also from what I've seen of CS it seems really uncomfortable because of its excessive syntax sugar" ~ ConsciousCode
"Making it really hard to tell what's even going on" ~ ConsciousCode
"I feel weirdly anxious for no reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"so, I'm technically at work. Oh yea, why is that?" ~ jamezq
"It started when I thought Espresso couldn't actually work because of structures like DAGs" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then I remembered you could refer to names rather than data" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then I shared a video I thought was really "profound" about Islam and was told it was stupid" ~ ConsciousCode
"So that raised it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But now nothing's really wrong so idk" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh the discussion with EnKrypt about time did some too for some reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"But ye EnKrypt it sounds like we agree on how time works" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it's really fucking with me though. It's both majestic and lonely at the same time." ~ EnKrypt
"about islam?" ~ jamezq
"Because it means nothing really is. Everyone's already dead." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah basically "it's not misogynistic, it's misanthropic"" ~ ConsciousCode
""Already" is a meaningless concept" ~ ConsciousCode
"You're basically saying that you'll die eventually" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which you already knew" ~ ConsciousCode
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c7FJqpF0po" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I am stupid? We disagree on a lot though" ~ ConsciousCode
"(the guy who said it's stupid)" ~ ConsciousCode
"this video does not exist" ~ jamezq
"Well I don't really care about the inevitability of death per se, but it's just that the word "happen" doesn't make much sense anymore." ~ EnKrypt
"Everything's already happened." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh sorry, must've cut it off" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm still stuck somewhere in the middle not yet caught up." ~ EnKrypt
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c7FJqpF0po" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's... the same link" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I just confirmed that it works" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nah EnKrypt, your problem is you're still attached to the idea of objectivity" ~ ConsciousCode
"All of those problems go away when you focus on subjectivity and abandon objectivity" ~ ConsciousCode
"that one worke" ~ jamezq
"anyway I will watch later " ~ jamezq
"but thank you wonderful sir" ~ jamezq
"But if it's subjective, why can't I do fancy tricks with it?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's not bound by objective rules." ~ EnKrypt
"Can you change what your beliefs are on a whim?" ~ ConsciousCode
"So why can't I skip to f(t=20yearsold)" ~ EnKrypt
"Subjective doesn't mean controllable" ~ ConsciousCode
"Your memories are subjective but you can't change them, generally" ~ ConsciousCode
"Your experience of the world is subjective but you don't suddenly see a tree as a mouse" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah, but this means even if I could, I wouldn't know it." ~ EnKrypt
"If I skipped to being 20, I'd still have memories from all the way to being 20." ~ EnKrypt
"Without having skipped it." ~ EnKrypt
"Then you're not skipping" ~ ConsciousCode
"*I* am, my memories can't." ~ EnKrypt
""Skipping" across f is meaningless unless that skipping affects f" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right, I figured we'd be back on that." ~ EnKrypt
"20-year-old you "already" exists and always has and always will" ~ ConsciousCode
"Its a still frame that's eternally held" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you can't skip to that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Precisely because there is no you to skip to" ~ ConsciousCode
"Your memories are you" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can't skip" ~ ConsciousCode
"That means though, that I can exist at all times." ~ EnKrypt
"Because doing so, unless you keep your memories, means "you" is no longer existent in the present" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, it means "you" as the identity has and always will exist forever" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whenever I want. although I guess in that context the "when" in whenever no long hold meaning" ~ EnKrypt
"I think you're confused about what is meant by "you"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Please define "you"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or "I", whichever" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sum total of memories?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or something along those lines" ~ EnKrypt
"No, I get it though. You're right. I reached the same conclusion." ~ EnKrypt
"I generally hold "youness" to be self-identification, which is usually predicated on memories" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't skip for the same reason that there's is no now to skip from, and no then to skip to." ~ EnKrypt
"So if some crazy person thought they were actually me, they'd be me" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's for consistency reasons" ~ ConsciousCode
"Namely how identity works when you consider AI clones" ~ ConsciousCode
"I used to just call it memories but I think it's neater to make them not totally necessary" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then amnesia + still know I'm the me from before is still me" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, but if I took you out, and put someone else in your memories, they'd then think they're you." ~ EnKrypt
"What part of them exists in that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Uhh, I can't take you out without also taking our your memories can I lol" ~ EnKrypt
"What makes the result any different from me right now?" ~ ConsciousCode
"No part. Because they're you now." ~ EnKrypt
"Ye that's my thoughts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Interestingly" ~ ConsciousCode
"This would suggest that any instance of this body which lacks self awareness isn't me" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. the body as a baby" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I suppose I could retroactively self-identify?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah animals can do it too." ~ EnKrypt
"I still think it's the memories." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah that makes sense, since I have memories of me before I was self aware" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think the memories are just the usual predicate" ~ ConsciousCode
"Consider an AI copy of yourself that has all its memories wiped but knows that it's you" ~ ConsciousCode
"Know that it's EnKrypt, or know that's it's a copy?" ~ EnKrypt
"If it's a perfect AI, I guess that doesn't matter." ~ EnKrypt
"But still though, how would it?" ~ EnKrypt
"What would it's anchor be, relative to determining that it is me?" ~ EnKrypt
"Anchors aren't necessary in human thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"People very often hold what I call "irrational" beliefs, which is to say beliefs/feelings which lack a "reason" for them" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if it has no memories, that means it has never been me before" ~ EnKrypt
"So say it had your sense of youness" ~ ConsciousCode
"But none of the memories to support it" ~ ConsciousCode
"what gives it this youness though?" ~ EnKrypt
"Which is possible because every time you feel like yourself, you aren't querying every single memory of you" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or is that what you're trying to get at too?" ~ EnKrypt
"Youness is a feeling, not a.. conclusion" ~ ConsciousCode
"feeling like yourself is also a pretty ambigous thing." ~ EnKrypt
"No in this case feeling like "the original"" ~ ConsciousCode
"So human-EnKrypt and AI-EnKrypt" ~ ConsciousCode
"AI-Enkrypt has no memory" ~ ConsciousCode
"But feels like "EnKrypt"" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's hard to tell. We have no like no information to go on from here." ~ EnKrypt
"But even with that assumption, I can't think of any factor that would make the AI think it's me." ~ EnKrypt
"I mean there's the whole cognitive memory thing where you automatically know how to do certain tasks you became adept at, and have preferences towards certain things." ~ EnKrypt
"They aren't tied directly to active memories per se, but imo they still count as some component of memory because they were optimized as a result of them." ~ EnKrypt
"You don't seem to be able to separate feelings from conclusions" ~ ConsciousCode
"Interesting" ~ ConsciousCode
"And we don't really need information here, we're going on philosophy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Presume certain things and go from there" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. "we can make an exact replica of someone in the form of a computer"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Have you never come across a feeling or opinion in your thoughts that wasn't based on any evidence or had no train of thought backing it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like how some emotional expressions lack rationality, in the sense that you can't explain why you're having them" ~ ConsciousCode
"I usually just discard them after I'm done enjoying/sulking in them. I've never seen those feelings as reliable enough to draw conclusions on." ~ EnKrypt
"That's a mistake" ~ ConsciousCode
"That they exist in the first place means they have a cause" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sure, evolutionary." ~ EnKrypt
"Even if you can't deduce what that cause is, it can be used to form rational understandings of yourself" ~ ConsciousCode
"Psychologically" ~ ConsciousCode
"But factoring them in calculations usually means that I have to extend my margin of error by that amount too." ~ EnKrypt
"Irrational feelings have no margin of error" ~ ConsciousCode
"That concept only applies to rational thoughts" ~ ConsciousCode
"The rational thought in this case is "I had this feeling <symbol representing your memory of the feeling>"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which I think most would consider a fact, so 0% margin of error" ~ ConsciousCode
"But even if I said "I had this feeling of being me exclusive of my memories", it wouldn't mean much." ~ EnKrypt
"It's as informative as "I had this feeling of being at an orgy with the characters in MLP"" ~ EnKrypt
"But what does your having that feeling mean?" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you feel guilty for going, what does that say about your thoughts on MLP?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or sexuality in general?" ~ ConsciousCode
"The only thing it can rationally mean, is that I had that feeling." ~ EnKrypt
"Since I didn't really go, and just had that feeling, it doesn't really say much about my guilt, or my sexuality" ~ EnKrypt
"I thought you meant a feeling after attending" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I'd still argue against that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Big eyebrow raise" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm secretly a clopfic writer." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't really understand why you don't get what I mean" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well I talk in hypotheticals while philosophizing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Let me get this straight" ~ ConsciousCode
"You think about attending an MLP orgy" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then have a feeling of guilt associated with it" ~ ConsciousCode
"You don't think that says ANYTHING about who you are,....?" ~ ConsciousCode
"My memories about those thoughts and feelings might..." ~ EnKrypt
"But that's not what you want me to say. :P" ~ EnKrypt
"It's still hard to say though because thoughts and feelings *can* be random too." ~ EnKrypt
"Even if they're not always." ~ EnKrypt
"And whenever they're not, it's usually led on by some "memory" from before." ~ EnKrypt
"Or some preference, or skill created by a past experience." ~ EnKrypt
"But you don't necessarily recognize those memories,  preferences, or beliefs" ~ ConsciousCode
"And you do know what "hypothetical" means, right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, I agree it might say something about me." ~ EnKrypt
"What I'm saying is those feelings could be inspired themselves from memories." ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, could, but not necessarily in a way you recognize" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can conceive of a train of thought in which you feel a certain way without any memories which provide a reason for feeling that way" ~ ConsciousCode
"And if you still have a feeling of being, despite having had any memories at all, I really can't think of where you'd get that feeling from," ~ EnKrypt
"You don't need a recognizable source for a feeling" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe. I mean I can imagine it, but it's like thinking about a while(true) loop breaking without a break statement." ~ EnKrypt
"You'll never know for sure, until it happens." ~ EnKrypt
"So you've never had a feeling with no precedent" ~ ConsciousCode
"Something where asking "why" draws a blank" ~ ConsciousCode
"Loads of times." ~ EnKrypt
"I know the why is there. I just don't know it." ~ EnKrypt
"So conceive of a thought where the "why" is axiomatic - you have the feeling because you have it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm terrible at deeling with feelings, so I have to make that assumption a lot, else I couldn't function lol" ~ EnKrypt
"I doubt any human has something like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"But since it's conceivable, it's possible to experience" ~ ConsciousCode
"And thus a more flexible mind could be made to think it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Need to go. Ttyl." ~ EnKrypt
"Do you think I could start a religion?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Me and others have noticed that the stuff I proselytize about is an awful lot like Jesus' teachings" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unending compassion and empathy, turn the other cheek, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I desperately want to instill this in the world" ~ ConsciousCode
"One way to force it is with Conscious Co, which eats problems and shits money" ~ ConsciousCode
"But a religion would make people /want/ to change" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yea, you would have to lie and write a book and say god gave you the words" ~ jamezq
"but then boom" ~ jamezq
"I think you could" ~ jamezq
"Nah, new age makes it easier" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could just say it came to me in meditation" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or I communicated with Us during meditation and wrote what We said" ~ ConsciousCode
"But basically" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm going to wrap my philosophies in a spiritualistic/metaphysical package" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because they're really dense/hard to understand for most, but a metaphysics would make that much easier" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm also going to try to toss in some connections to other world religions" ~ ConsciousCode
"That seems to add to successes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Every big religion that isn't ancient started by saying it's an older religion but made new" ~ ConsciousCode
"Christianity, Judaism and God actually loves everyone" ~ ConsciousCode
"Islam, Judaism and etc  etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"Buddhism, like Hinduism but follow the eight fold path" ~ ConsciousCode
"Mormonism, Christianity lost its way, with each sect having only a piece of the whole truth" ~ ConsciousCode
"so you gunna write a book?" ~ jamezq
"I think a book might be too much" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want accessibility" ~ ConsciousCode
"And there's not all that much I need to say anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"Most of it follows from a few axioms" ~ ConsciousCode
"yea but a big complicated book gives people an excuse to study it and find their own meaning to answer everything" ~ jamezq
"and suit every purpose" ~ jamezq
"So does having something so vague and general that it can apply to anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"so what form will it be in?" ~ jamezq
"I don't know actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"See the thing with books too is that most people don't read anymore" ~ ConsciousCode
"The internet is where things are" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it probably has to be something on the internet" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I think some random website would look sketchy" ~ ConsciousCode
"It needs some way to go viral and be easily shared" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yet in a form which seems safe and trustworthy" ~ ConsciousCode
"but the thing is people don't need to read it" ~ jamezq
"most christians don't actually *read* the bible" ~ jamezq
"they listen to others quote and talk about it" ~ jamezq
"simply *having* the book, where people assume all the answers are, is enough" ~ jamezq
"people don't need to actually read it." ~ jamezq
"in fact it's better if they don't" ~ jamezq
"that way the book contains wherever the answer is, any solution it has, and perfect world, it describes, etc." ~ jamezq
"But yea, simply it's existence, a book that is very wordery and hard to understand, and full of metaphors will multiple interpretations, is powerver." ~ jamezq
"Idk how useful this'll be but I made a poem" ~ ConsciousCode
"Probably too cheesy for anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just don't know how to start" ~ ConsciousCode
"When all there was was there there was a deity that dreamt. Within those dreams were wishes where much of time was spent. An eternity of adventure and pleasure and hope, yet satisfaction is but a fraction of making existence meaningful; conflict is needed, not heeded but lived along with the blissful. Villains for heroes, excitement for climax, but aeons make even that limbo. So what’s there to do to quench this persistence " ~ ConsciousCode
"but dream a life for you?" ~ ConsciousCode
"All there was" ~ ConsciousCode
"I thought it was a cute but confusing way to phrase it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Will you be one of my disciples JQ? :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm going to make sure none of it touches on physicality and it's all metaphysical, so there's nothing to really object to" ~ ConsciousCode
"That is, it won't presume wishy-washy stuff like souls, it'll keep those as a kind of philosophical quandary" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll read all of what you write" ~ jamezq
"http://observer.com/2016/07/wikileaks-proves-primary-was-rigged-dnc-undermined-democracy/" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yes I know, I saw that" ~ jamezq
"I have been following the elections pretty closely" ~ jamezq
"but ty for posting it" ~ jamezq
"G is making me mad" ~ jamezq
"G, the universal Gravitation Constant" ~ jamezq
"it ruined everything " ~ jamezq
"everything else so far just follows from math, light has to be this speed because of these things. we don't have to measure it." ~ jamezq
"force being m*a, torque, etc, other constants" ~ jamezq
"are not really constants" ~ jamezq
"just coeffecients" ~ jamezq
"that end up in the equation after integrating or something" ~ jamezq
"but G is just some constant that we have to measure" ~ jamezq
"and we only know it to like...6 sigfigs" ~ jamezq
"kinda crazy" ~ jamezq
"Probably something quantum then" ~ ConsciousCode
"the only thing that would make me feel better is if G was just a "scale"" ~ jamezq
"It is though" ~ ConsciousCode
"like if we used the universes prefered united" ~ jamezq
"G would just be 1" ~ jamezq
"and thus it does not actually exist" ~ jamezq
"Gravity is the inverse square law scaled by G" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't mean that" ~ jamezq
"I mean a scale of our units" ~ jamezq
"Kg vs whatever unit makes G 0" ~ jamezq
"however, as I am reading, it does not seem to be the case" ~ jamezq
"there are units of measurment that use G = 1" ~ jamezq
"they are neat" ~ jamezq
"but they don't solve the issue" ~ jamezq
"I'm reading about other constants now, that we just have to measure empircally" ~ jamezq
"which is disgusting" ~ jamezq
"I like knowing stuff to infinite figures if we wanted" ~ jamezq
"like pi, e, speed of light, etc." ~ jamezq
"and we don't need to experiment with them to know it, just to confirm" ~ jamezq
"they simply fall out of the theories we make" ~ jamezq
"G does not, I mean, the *existence* of G does, the value does not." ~ jamezq
"You cannot thought experiment G, afaik" ~ jamezq
"anyway, maybe if we find out more about gravity we will be able to one day" ~ jamezq

"there is some intersting stuff that I have seen" ~ jamezq
"that the value of G as it is tested follows a wave pattern" ~ jamezq
"Does G factor into relativity?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I know it's in Newtonian but" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yes einstein uses G" ~ jamezq
"we don't even know for sure if G is constant" ~ jamezq
"we just think so" ~ jamezq
"kinda crazy, " ~ jamezq
"but it is constant enough, and small enough, that knowing a few digits is fine to get to mars, etc" ~ jamezq
"A long-sought goal of theoretical physics is to find first principles ("Theory of Everything") from which all of the fundamental dimensionless constants can be calculated and compared to the measured values." ~ jamezq
"so the "Theory of Everything" I have been hearing about since I was a kid" ~ jamezq
"would solve that" ~ jamezq
"aparently there are 25 such constants in the standard model" ~ jamezq
"but a new theory would hope to remove them all." ~ jamezq
"people have tried to find math behind constants, some suceeding, some failing" ~ jamezq
"Arthur Eddington set out alleged mathematical reasons why the reciprocal of the fine structure constant had to be exactly 136." ~ jamezq
"When its value was discovered to be closer to 137, he changed his argument to match that value.[When its value was discovered to be closer to 137, he changed his argument to match that value.[" ~ jamezq
"Experiments have since shown that Eddington was wrong; to six significant digits, the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant is 137.036." ~ jamezq
"Mothing fucking .036" ~ jamezq
"An empirical relation between the masses of the electron, muon and tau has been discovered by physicist Yoshio Koide, but this formula remains unexplained." ~ jamezq
"So that might be useful, or maybe just again math make simply to make the numbers work" ~ jamezq
"rather than the the numbers happening to fall out" ~ jamezq
"we aparently eliminated a lot of constants" ~ jamezq
"when we confirmed the existence of the Higgs boson in 2013" ~ jamezq
"so hey, work is being done" ~ jamezq
"There is an intersting book" ~ jamezq
"Just Six Numbers" ~ jamezq
"And aparently it talks about how you can't just pick numbers for these constants" ~ jamezq
"they basically have to be the values they are or other things break down" ~ jamezq
"but we don't know enough about it to know them exactly" ~ jamezq
"but we can't just gen a new universe with a G of 8x10^-11" ~ jamezq

"It's a nonsensical one founded in a poor understanding of what one considers identity" ~ ConsciousCode
"Consider the hypothetical that the universe is destroyed completely and remade every second" ~ ConsciousCode

"so it seems that is all that would happen" ~ jamezq
"I would just die, loose my counsciousness, and a copy would replace me" ~ jamezq
"Ok counter counter example" ~ ConsciousCode
"Suppose we got brain uploads to work" ~ ConsciousCode
"You know as well as anyone that computers copy and move their data alllll the time" ~ ConsciousCode

"sure that is true" ~ jamezq
"So what does that mean for the AI's notion of continued existence?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I contend that the only meaningful notion of identity is some combination of memories and self-identity" ~ ConsciousCode
"If original-you died, there'd be no other you to be you" ~ ConsciousCode
"So "you" would only be the copy" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's not a "transfer", it's the alternate continuation of you from a previous point (the point of teleportation)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I imagine AI's would either be comfortable with it, as humans might be, maybe having so sense of counsciousness as humans have, a driver behind the wheel." ~ jamezq

"Consciousness is patterns" ~ ConsciousCode

"but I still would not do it" ~ jamezq

"I think he had principles" ~ ConsciousCode

"but they really did cheat him badly" ~ jamezq
"they tried to do the same to trump too" ~ jamezq

"So you know @name makes an object that refers to the name itself rather than its contents" ~ ConsciousCode
"So theoretically f(@x) should call the function in a way which the provided object may change its value "later on"" ~ ConsciousCode
"This becomes an issue when this is used as an inplace modification" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say, if you have function incr(x) { x += 1; }, it isn't immediately evident that this function should do anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I think this is a problem because that disables a lot of optimizations" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I had a thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"x is a name referring to a name here" ~ ConsciousCode
"But x = 0 only assigns to x, not the name it refers to" ~ ConsciousCode
"So in this case it really would do nothing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Instead, you could make the invocation function incr(@x) { x += 1; }" ~ ConsciousCode
"This tells the program that x is meant to be modifiable in a way which is theoretically visible to the caller" ~ ConsciousCode
"But now what does incr(0) do?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think this has a simple solution; incr(0) is equivalent to var x = 0; incr(@x);" ~ ConsciousCode
"x here is some arbitrary temporary which isn't accessible to the enclosing scope" ~ ConsciousCode
"So incr is still a no-op, though it might not be able to optimize that out" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh and for clarification" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah, so @x is force pass by reference?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's not "force"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Note that incr(x) is a no-op" ~ ConsciousCode
"The function incr(@x) says "I expect this to be a name", but it can't convert a non-name to a name" ~ ConsciousCode
"So instead it pretends it's a name, as some unreferencable temporary" ~ ConsciousCode
"@x can be thought of as a pointer to data" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or a pointer to a pointer? I think that's better" ~ ConsciousCode
"Wait what lol" ~ EnKrypt
"When I say var y = @x" ~ ConsciousCode
"Essentially what I'm doing is saying" ~ ConsciousCode
"struct var* y = wrap_name(&x);" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where wrap_name makes a name object, of type struct var*" ~ ConsciousCode
"I feel like I accidentally walked into the wrong class." ~ EnKrypt
"I understood a few words here and there lol." ~ EnKrypt
"y is an object which refers to the name "x"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whatever that name refers to, doesn't matter" ~ ConsciousCode
"How does a reference to a "name" work?" ~ EnKrypt
"To me it sounds like you're just making y point to the same address." ~ EnKrypt
"No, y's pointing to the address of the address" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well first, note that data in espresso is immutable by definition" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if it's in C, it's like saying cont int* x = make_int(8);" ~ ConsciousCode
"*cont -> const" ~ ConsciousCode
"x itself is mutable, you can set it to a new value" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you can't change the value of 8" ~ ConsciousCode
"Such an idea is nonsensical" ~ ConsciousCode
"What we're doing here isn't saying 0 = 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"We're assigning 1 to x, when it was previously 0" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now imagine if you abstracted this "name" x, say y = &x or y = @x" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now, y refers to x which refers to 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if you say x = 2, y = @x = 2" ~ ConsciousCode
"But 0 != 1 and 1 != 2" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok gotta go bb" ~ ConsciousCode
"Come up with questions pls" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll be back in a couple hours" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually, I had a few questions right from the start, past which began the confusion." ~ EnKrypt
"If you're on when I wake up, I'll get them clarified." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok EnKrypt_" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh good I didn't go to bed yet" ~ EnKrypt
"NERVE is a fucking amazing movie" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now I wanna make a decentralized computing platform" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like veid.io but more general" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol maybe finish one of your existing projects? :P" ~ EnKrypt
"So did you have questions?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Technically this gives me an opportunity to develop Glu some too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right, so based on what I understood : y sees x as x sees 1 (or 2 or whatever fixed value is given to it), right?" ~ EnKrypt
"Huh, that is actually pretty neat" ~ EnKrypt
"So your concern is optimization?" ~ EnKrypt
"Optimization and consistency" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which more often than not go together" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want lua-like tables, which allow any object to be used as a key" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where making the signature be incr(@x) is like telling the compiler that x will be modified and the modifications will be reflected" ~ EnKrypt
"But that can't work if objects are mutable, since the keys would change too (unless they were copied which is a hack)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well I'm not sure what the difference between calling a function with @x and defining a function with @x in its signature is." ~ EnKrypt
"Nerve looks good." ~ EnKrypt
"But it's not airing here for some reason" ~ EnKrypt
"The difference is a matter of matching" ~ ConsciousCode
"Both need to be @ for modification to occur" ~ ConsciousCode
"If the function doesn't use @, any assignments to the name are strictly local" ~ ConsciousCode
"If the function isn't called with @, an unreferenceable temporary is used instead" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if you call a @ function with @, everything matches and any assignments will work as expected" ~ ConsciousCode
"This way you can't break contracts accidentally" ~ ConsciousCode
"Consider a function which modifies its arguments for convenience (like x -= 1 in a loop)" ~ ConsciousCode
"It doesn't expect x to be anything but local, which might not be immediately obvious to the caller" ~ ConsciousCode
"So making sure the @'s match just guarantees everyone's on the same page" ~ ConsciousCode
"(and enables more optimizations)" ~ ConsciousCode
"(since non-@ in functions can be guaranteed to not need special methods for assignment)" ~ ConsciousCode
"And how does optimization work on that page?" ~ EnKrypt
"on that note/context" ~ EnKrypt
"If a local variable x could actually be @y under the hood, you'd have to check any time an assignment was done" ~ ConsciousCode
"x = 1 would become" ~ ConsciousCode
"if(x.isRef()) { *x = 1; } else { x = 1; }" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if x is @x, then you can know that ALL updates should be *x = 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"Same with the other end actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"If passing x could mean x was actually @x, you'd have to always pass it as @x" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which also means you can't do constant substitution" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since everything you pass to a function could be changed without knowing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Huh, yeah makes sense." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm new to this lol, so all this is like new revelations to me. I wish I was of more help." ~ EnKrypt
"No it's fine I just wanted to vent I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol please make Espresso a thing" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah? Why? :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"And not some idea you abandon halfway through again." ~ EnKrypt
"Because I like it." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh that's guaranteed EnKrypt-kun" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everything I do is a waste of time" ~ ConsciousCode
"All the more reason to might as well finish this along the way" ~ EnKrypt
"Nothing like wasting time productively lmao" ~ EnKrypt
"The decentralized platform might be small enough to accomplish before I become a weeny" ~ ConsciousCode
"I would use the fuck out of Espresso." ~ EnKrypt
"Why not make it yourself? :B" ~ ConsciousCode
"A lot of paradigms you're introducing are things that I imagined would solve problems I've had before, but nothing direct existed as that point." ~ EnKrypt
"Lack of experience mostly." ~ EnKrypt
"No clue where to start, not even what I need to know along the way." ~ EnKrypt
"Closest I've come to building a language is writing JPL, which isn't quite close to this." ~ EnKrypt
"implemented I guess. JQ "built" the language." ~ EnKrypt
"I have some codebase already" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've slowed down because idk how to approach the IR system" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where? Your repo has just that one commit." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't use git all that much these days because I don't tend to go anywhere" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's a pretty popular IPFS thread on 8ch's /tech/ board rn." ~ EnKrypt
"Have they said anything exciting?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Going through" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm surprised it's gotten this much attention" ~ EnKrypt
"It's a good idea and I guess techies recognize that" ~ ConsciousCode
"WARNING: THIS SHIT IS WRITTEN IN GO." ~ EnKrypt
"THAT'S RIGHT, WHOEVER IS MAKING THIS PROJECT IS CLINICALLY INSANE." ~ EnKrypt
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS." ~ EnKrypt
"They're porting to other languages I think" ~ ConsciousCode
"">file system that seeks to connect all computing devices" ~ EnKrypt
">everyone is connected to everyone" ~ EnKrypt
"The ultimate botnet?"" ~ EnKrypt
"It's not a botnet unless it does arbitrary computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's what my thing is for :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah lol I figured." ~ EnKrypt
"but /g/ and /tech/ have this irrational fear where everything becomes a "muh botnet" meme" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok EnKrypt I have a conundrum" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's probably just an injoke with newfags who fell for it" ~ ConsciousCode
"My.... distributed computation VM thingy, dunno what to call it, lambdas (the unit of currency) are supposed to be a roughly 1:1 correspondence between computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"When you do computation for the network, you get rewarded in much the same way as bitcoin, where you get the currency contained within the block (distributed to your peers)" ~ ConsciousCode
"What you're essentially doing is trading your computation for abstract-computation, which you can later redeem" ~ ConsciousCode
"But last night I realized that I have no mechanism in my system for producing lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's always net-neutral at most" ~ ConsciousCode
"And even if I started the system with some random number of lambdas, there's still no mechanism to make mor" ~ ConsciousCode
"It sounds to be that the solution would be something along the lines of "wait till x amount of computation is done, then increment lambda count"." ~ EnKrypt
"Along which step are you stuck" ~ EnKrypt
"Idk it's just a scheme like that feels like it devalues that 1:1 correspondence" ~ ConsciousCode
"1:1 to what" ~ EnKrypt
"You're no longer trading computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"1 lambda : 1 VM cycle" ~ ConsciousCode
"That sounds fixed enough for you to be able to force 1:1." ~ EnKrypt
"Or can 1 VM cycle vary?" ~ EnKrypt
"Well a VM cycle is the same as a CPU cycle" ~ ConsciousCode
"Some operations take more cycles than others" ~ ConsciousCode
"So they're more expensive" ~ ConsciousCode
"And yes but that no longer works if I pull lambdas out of thin air" ~ ConsciousCode
"That lambda no longer represents a unit of computation that was done long ago and is now being traded once again" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's more a system-mandate that it represents a computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then it gains that value over time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you mean that you're having trouble converting computation to lambda while still maintaining that lambdas can only be transferred, not created?" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean, you *can* create bitcoins out of thin air though can't you?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes but they have intrinsic value" ~ ConsciousCode
"It takes a fuckton of computation to mine a bitconi" ~ ConsciousCode
"That wasn't always the case" ~ EnKrypt
"It takes /any/ computation then" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you don't even have to take care of that. It's not like you're going to have a system to handle inflation and shit. " ~ EnKrypt
"And is thus some representation of effort" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok brilliant idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lambdas can be made in some way an awful lot like bitcoins" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the value you get after minting them is related to the difficulty to mint it" ~ ConsciousCode
"That way, newly minted lambdas are representative of actual computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the system itself doesn't depend on lambda minting" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like bitcoin does, which wastes computation and energy" ~ ConsciousCode
"So eventually when they become too difficult to mint, people will just engage in the net-neutral stuff like any normal currency" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whereas in bitcoin any transfer of value requires the generation of new value" ~ ConsciousCode
"And thus there's an end-state where bitcoin just becomes worthless because no one can spend anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, I'm not sure about minting and stuff, and I probably don't even know about p2p lingo, but here's how I think it should work with 0 problems." ~ EnKrypt
"Idk if my metaphors will match yours" ~ EnKrypt
"System starts with a computation "task" having been completed." ~ EnKrypt
"And according to however lambdas per computation you've specified, the system gains that many lambdas." ~ EnKrypt
"Now, those lambdas can be traded with someone else" ~ EnKrypt
"To do another task "x"" ~ EnKrypt
"No, my bad." ~ EnKrypt
"You redeem them for doing task x" ~ EnKrypt
"You can trade it with someone else as normal currency" ~ EnKrypt
"Mhm sounds good" ~ ConsciousCode
"When you "redeem" a lambda, what you're actually doing is distributing it equally to all members of a group" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everyone who did the computation for you" ~ EnKrypt
"Will get their share" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok that's another wrinkle" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think an entire group should perform the same computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"There needs to be redundancy, but redundancy on that level is wasteful" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah you'll have to write some insane algorithm to figure out what parts of the task is distributable, and how to handle a member not completing their task properly without creating extra lambdas." ~ EnKrypt
"But then you can't have a proper consensus protocol if the entire group isn't participating" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because they won't include it in the block unless it benefits them" ~ ConsciousCode
"And no, I have computation handled" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everything is intrinsically parallelized using a CPS form" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically every computation "returns" with the next computation to perform" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh that's sweet." ~ EnKrypt
"Wait, that sounds linear." ~ EnKrypt
"Not parralel" ~ EnKrypt
"It's linear to a thread" ~ ConsciousCode
"And there's ways to make them return more than one computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I still haven't figured out synchronizing between threads" ~ ConsciousCode
"Another issue I'm having is how the transfer of value actually works" ~ ConsciousCode
"Should the site have an internal loop that consumes lambdas over time?" ~ ConsciousCode
"But imo though, redundancy won't work properly among jobs. Since you still have to give them value for having done the computation. And now there will be extra lambdas floating around." ~ EnKrypt
"Or should users put lambdas into the system and let it perform computations to a point'" ~ ConsciousCode
"Extra lambdas aren't too bad" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's tricks I can pull to distribute them" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just have to make sure there's always an integer count of lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"I feel like having extra lambdas be created like that could be exploited." ~ EnKrypt
"Mind you they're not created" ~ ConsciousCode
"If they're extra, they will be though, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"Even if they're proof of actual computation" ~ EnKrypt
"At worst they're lost to the system as irretrievable, the way bitcoins are in unused accounts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Someone else did the same computation" ~ EnKrypt
"I'll think about it later I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"So how should computation be distributed?" ~ ConsciousCode
"How is bitcoin distributed?" ~ EnKrypt
"Network-wide, in a sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everyone is working at the same level" ~ ConsciousCode
"And blocks are communicated when someone finds one" ~ ConsciousCode
"But here I need blocks to be much faster" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm using veid.io's lockstep scheme, where every member of the group gets the same penalized split of the sum of the values in the block" ~ ConsciousCode
"This prevents stratification of self-interest, because one's self-interest is equivalent to the group's self-interest" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it also makes computation redundancy... weird" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since you can't break that group up to perform certain computations or else that stratification comes back" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you can't do delegations, i.e. have subgroups that randomly come together because then both they AND the larger group need to be compensated" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could make that the remainder...?" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then an evenly split computation will never be included because it has 0 value" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also most computations won't be capable of being evenly split anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"Blocks are necessary to ensure that it's worth doing the computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because you can't split 1 lambda, it's indivisible" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if you have 10 members in your group you'll want around 10 computations in the block" ~ ConsciousCode
"Fucking hell" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't do any delegation at all because everyone needs compensation" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean penalties can never be 0" ~ ConsciousCode
"So a block will always have some excess...." ~ ConsciousCode
"But that makes blocks with higher penalties more likely to be added to the metablock" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't really remember the penalty thing from veid.io" ~ EnKrypt
"It was a way to guide the utility of groups" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't give them more value for doing good things" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because that would devalue the currency" ~ ConsciousCode
"So instead I penalize undesirable behavior" ~ ConsciousCode
"For instance, in Veid.io blocks were penalized based on the amount of time between the newest and oldest transactions within it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where "time" is some number that's part of the transaction, not necessarily correlated to time but will be in general" ~ ConsciousCode
"That makes sure they don't make an enormous block and take eons until they finally release it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But without requiring some kind of time synchronization" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is inconsistent and has bad end-states" ~ ConsciousCode
"And it also means that they aren't penalized for processing transactions that are a few seconds old" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if you start to work on a block by yourself, and take too long, you eventually lose more value than you gain?" ~ EnKrypt
"Something like that?" ~ EnKrypt
""Taking too long" is undefined here" ~ ConsciousCode
"What this does is penalize grouping transactions which are far apart in time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which can't be spoofed because the time is signed by the transaction requester" ~ ConsciousCode
"And from that going fast will be a natural course of action, since you can't wait around for newer transactions or risk devaluing them" ~ ConsciousCode
"And you want to process as many as possible" ~ ConsciousCode
"But what if I was the only guy in the entire network and I received the transaction really late myself?" ~ EnKrypt
"Late doesn't matter" ~ ConsciousCode
"What matters is the difference in time between the "newest" and "oldest" within the block" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could get them a million years late, but as long as you don't group it with other transactions that are newer it'll have the same value as a million years ago" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though you will be penalized for not having transactions within the same time period" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wasn't even going to require that blocks maintain a strict time-ordering" ~ ConsciousCode
"And btw, since there's no way to guarantee that time correlates with actual time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Someone could submit a transaction and claim it's a million years old and it'd still be valid" ~ ConsciousCode
"But no one will/should do that because it'd have so little value that it's worth less than the RAM it takes up" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since there won't be any other transactions to group it with and a block with a single transaction is virtually worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
"Same thing with a transaction that claims it was made a million years in the future" ~ ConsciousCode
"People will generally want to use the current GMT time because that's what everyone else is using" ~ ConsciousCode
"And if they're close to everyone else, they'll be processed with everyone else" ~ ConsciousCode
"EnKrypt kun D:" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sorry, give me a while." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah makes sense." ~ EnKrypt
"So why won't applying this to your VM lambda idea work?" ~ EnKrypt
"Well it will, that wasn't the problem" ~ ConsciousCode
"The problem is that the peers that do your computations already took all the value from your request" ~ ConsciousCode
"So a global blockchain would have no incentive to include it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I could make just two layers" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess that's where you could throw in your idea of making extra lambdas." ~ EnKrypt
"Local computation and global blockchain" ~ ConsciousCode
"Mmmmmaaaybe, hm" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though then I get all of bitcoin's problems" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could handle redundancy this way too." ~ EnKrypt
"No need, it won't count as mining" ~ EnKrypt
"Well presumably you're saying H(aggregate of all state-changes + nonce) < difficulty" ~ ConsciousCode
"Uhh, really not familiar with that lingo." ~ EnKrypt
"So as difficulty rises to levels which are unsustainable or unprofitable, no one will care enough to manage the blockchain" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, just append them to tasks being redeemed." ~ EnKrypt
"H(x) is a hash of x" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I'm getting this wrong" ~ EnKrypt
"nonces are random bits which change the hash" ~ ConsciousCode
"And actually it should be > difficulty" ~ ConsciousCode
"But is this the only way to do transactions?" ~ EnKrypt
"Did veid.io have the same principle?" ~ EnKrypt
"No most likely not, I just haven't thought of alternatives" ~ ConsciousCode
"Veid.io was small enough that its computations could be global" ~ ConsciousCode
"It essentially used a single group with a few thousand nodes which were replaced periodically" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well I know in the case of bitcoin, breaking a block gets increasingly harder." ~ EnKrypt
"But, does that mean there's simply more transactions per block?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or each transaction gets incresingly harder to process too?" ~ EnKrypt
"They actually get harder - the number of transactions per block doesn't actually affect difficulty" ~ ConsciousCode
"IIRC bitcoin looks for hashes that start with a certain number of 0s" ~ ConsciousCode
"If that wasn't the case, I think simply appending the transaction to the task being computed could work. They'd get a bit of extra lambda in the end." ~ EnKrypt
"Well yes that's what's already done" ~ ConsciousCode
"So does those specific hashes get more speced out? Or processing the hash itself gets tougher?" ~ EnKrypt
"A peer gets rewarded for computing a lambda" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hashes are pseudo random" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the more 0s you require at the beginning, the harder it gets (exponentially)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah, right right." ~ EnKrypt
"Though > difficulty is more general" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since you have more fine tuned control over it" ~ ConsciousCode

"yea go ahead" ~ jamezq
"A solar system that's 10 light years away is literally 10 years away" ~ ConsciousCode

"And it looks like I'm not the only one to think of it" ~ ConsciousCode
"that is intersting I have not heard that" ~ jamezq
"I have heard of velocity and time being just 2 dimensions" ~ jamezq
"imagine an x-y graph, one of them is velocity one of them is time" ~ jamezq
"everything travels at the speed of light" ~ jamezq
"but some things travel though time more, some travel though velocity more" ~ jamezq
"a photon, or anything going at the speed of light, does not experiance time at all" ~ jamezq
"so you can kinda think of it as a triangle with hypotonuse c" ~ jamezq
"Ok, that's interesting" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I think related" ~ ConsciousCode
"dr(t)/dt = dt(r)/dr" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does this make sense?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm spitballing here" ~ ConsciousCode
"The change in distance wrt time is the same as the change in time wrt distance" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually do the units even add up" ~ ConsciousCode
"change is distance with respect to time is v" ~ jamezq
"I guess if we're saying distance and time are the same, they should have the same units" ~ ConsciousCode
"So dr/dt and dt/dr should be unitless" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yea, x with respect to x" ~ jamezq
"so kinda like deviding by x" ~ jamezq
"which I don't know what that would mean" ~ jamezq
"Wolframalpha says that r(t) = t(r)t'(r) + C" ~ ConsciousCode

"for each observer" ~ jamezq
"I guess that would be spacetime" ~ jamezq
"looking up stuff about what you said now" ~ jamezq
"Future-you is a version of you which has traveled more distance" ~ ConsciousCode
"That actually explains why time is one-direction" ~ ConsciousCode
"Change in distance can't be negative" ~ ConsciousCode
"Distance can't be" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or if it could, it'd make time go "in reverse"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Space at a point in time is infinitesimal" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if a particle were to reach 0 K, wouldn't that mean the particle would exist in all locations?" ~ ConsciousCode
"As distance contracts, time contracts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Cold things travel less distance, so they experience less time?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Relative to us" ~ ConsciousCode
"but don't hot things experence less time, since the closer they move to c, the less time they experiance" ~ jamezq
"since light does not experiance time" ~ jamezq
"That'd mean distance and time are orthogonal" ~ ConsciousCode
"Light traveling c meters experiences 1 second of time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since distance is time" ~ ConsciousCode
"But what does that say about approaching c" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where we know time is slowed" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need math" ~ ConsciousCode
"The problem with intuitive reasoning here is that velocity and time are mutually independent" ~ ConsciousCode
"*mutually dependent" ~ ConsciousCode
"Velocity doesn't make sense without a "distance" in the "time dimension"" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that traversal through time requires knowing the velocity" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need ice cream" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I think there's something real to this idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because despite how the math works, distance stars being years in the past in the present of the observer is mathematically identical to the standard model" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is that they're both in the present but light can only go so fast" ~ ConsciousCode
"I should be approaching this via the relation" ~ ConsciousCode
"At a single point in time, the present, there is no space" ~ ConsciousCode
"The rest of the universe only becomes existent with a period of time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because distances are periods of time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Think of this as like" ~ ConsciousCode
"You stand in a void, and a planet is far away from you" ~ ConsciousCode
"You perceive the planet" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then we freeze the universe" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can no longer perceive the planet because the light will never reach you" ~ ConsciousCode
"There is no time so there is no distance" ~ ConsciousCode
"I suppose you can think of" ~ jamezq
"1/2 distance" ~ jamezq
"and 1/2 time" ~ jamezq
"Although interestingly enough" ~ ConsciousCode
"This still doesn't explain why it's c" ~ ConsciousCode
"I had a thought that this is kind of like standing on the "top" of a sphere" ~ ConsciousCode
"The rest of the points of the sphere are "beneath" you relative to your spot" ~ ConsciousCode
"And past the equator, they have a negative vertical component" ~ ConsciousCode
""Negative time"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or with the expanding universe" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's like a ship going over the horizon" ~ ConsciousCode
"You eventually can't see it" ~ ConsciousCode
"So maybe c is some kind of curvature" ~ ConsciousCode
"that is interesting" ~ jamezq
"I like that expanding universe thing" ~ jamezq
"that is neat" ~ jamezq
"Distance increases" ~ ConsciousCode
"And time decreases, somehow" ~ ConsciousCode
"Change in time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Change in time relative to the observer" ~ ConsciousCode
"Until such a point that the change in time is 0" ~ ConsciousCode
"(the point where expansion is faster than c)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does that mean that time starts going backwards elsewhere in the universe when it disappears forever?" ~ ConsciousCode
"What would that mean" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok confusion" ~ ConsciousCode
"How do you define velocity?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Any velocity will be some r/t" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which must be c" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does that even matter?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because velocity to the observer is unit" ~ ConsciousCode
"So how do you relate two observers" ~ ConsciousCode
"well lets see" ~ jamezq
"means change in speed" ~ jamezq
"That's acceleration" ~ ConsciousCode
"which is a change in time" ~ jamezq
"change in distance" ~ jamezq
"which is a change in time" ~ jamezq
"since you get closer" ~ jamezq
"ct gets smaller" ~ jamezq
"it takes less time to update" ~ jamezq
"so velocity kinda makes sense" ~ jamezq
"in that respect" ~ jamezq
"time gets smaller" ~ jamezq
"acc is time gets smaller faster" ~ jamezq
""Smaller" only makes sense relative to a reference frame" ~ ConsciousCode
"What we need to do is show that an object moving at some c will observe a difference in how a reference object moves which correlates to time dilation" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can't actually use immobile particles in this thought experiment because then the passage of time doesn't make sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"Objects must be moving to have time" ~ ConsciousCode
"So all time dilation should be related to the sum of the velocity vectors" ~ ConsciousCode
"Wait duh, relativity" ~ ConsciousCode
"We can treat the observer as being stationary, always" ~ ConsciousCode
"so stuff is moving to them" ~ jamezq
"and away "behind" them" ~ jamezq
"No let's try" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just something moving past it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then that gets confusing again because I'm thinking of time as the independent variable" ~ ConsciousCode
"Distance is total distance" ~ ConsciousCode
"http://www.quantumtheorys.com/Distance-Time/Figure%201.html" ~ jamezq
"So if you moved in a circle a few hundred times and ended where you started" ~ ConsciousCode
"You haven't moved in a circle in time" ~ ConsciousCode
"You've traveled a few hundred circumferences" ~ ConsciousCode
"the figures are interesting" ~ jamezq
"So I can't treat r as the distance to the object..." ~ ConsciousCode
"But I have to since that relates its distance to..." ~ ConsciousCode
"total distance traveled since 0 = ct" ~ ConsciousCode
"So t` = (d + r)/c" ~ ConsciousCode
"The new t is equal to the total distance plus the distance left" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that shouldn't matter since time is relative" ~ ConsciousCode
"g2g for now, ttyl" ~ jamezq
"this is interesting" ~ jamezq
"I will cont later, and maybe on my thing" ~ jamezq
"Recommend editors?" ~ EnKrypt
"I've been with Notepad++ for a really long while and its done the job really well." ~ EnKrypt
"I got bored of the omnicomputer whatever" ~ ConsciousCode
"today I want to make a math library" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's what you're calling the lambda thing?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah Notepad++ is the best Windows editor" ~ ConsciousCode
"And no I just dunno what to call it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But there's all this cross platform shit coming up." ~ EnKrypt
"Sublime, Atom, emacs, vim" ~ EnKrypt
"There's even something called VS Code" ~ EnKrypt
"Well emacs is kind of an industry skill" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could put it on your resume" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if you're willing to approach a spiral learning curve, emacs is your best option" ~ ConsciousCode
"Emacs binding is a whole new level of insanity from what I've heard" ~ EnKrypt
""Spiral lurning curve" - Lmao because http://mrozekma.com/editor-learning-curve.png" ~ EnKrypt
"Help? I don't know which one to choose." ~ EnKrypt
"My priority is definitely lightweight" ~ EnKrypt
"What OS first off" ~ ConsciousCode
"Cross platform" ~ EnKrypt
"Code Blocks?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want to keep using this even if I shift" ~ EnKrypt
"That's an IDE though" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, you just want an editor" ~ ConsciousCode
"Emacs is an IDE broseph :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"Emacs "can" be an IDE right?" ~ EnKrypt
"Code Blocks "can" be an editor" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, so is it light?" ~ EnKrypt
"Is it extensible?" ~ EnKrypt
"Those are my 2 criteria." ~ EnKrypt
"Define extensible" ~ ConsciousCode
"no bloatware. Extra features are just made into modules/plugins" ~ EnKrypt
"Like ftp editing." ~ EnKrypt
"Autocomplete" ~ EnKrypt
"Other fancy stuff" ~ EnKrypt
"I think that's a pretty tall order" ~ ConsciousCode
"Emacs is the only one I know of that does that off the top of my head" ~ ConsciousCode
"Npp does all that too lmao" ~ EnKrypt
"But I feel like that's where it ends" ~ EnKrypt
"And I've milked all I can out of this puppy without turning it into bloat" ~ EnKrypt
"What did you want to put in your math library?" ~ EnKrypt
"Anything in specific?" ~ EnKrypt
"Emacs is god" ~ jamezq
"There is no Emacs" ~ k
"Wanna help me remake the internet?" ~ ConsciousCode
"would there at least as much porn in it as there is in the current one?" ~ k
"Yes, and possibly lots more" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically I'm commoditizing CPU and RAM as abstract resources" ~ ConsciousCode
"So websites can be run by their users rather than central servers" ~ ConsciousCode
"You ask a server for something, and it asks you to pay for it, then gives it to you" ~ ConsciousCode
"so no free porn :/" ~ k
"Well yes free porn" ~ ConsciousCode
"When I say "pay", I mean pay in abstract virtual units which I call lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which are an integer currency roughly correlating to 1 VM CPU cycle" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you might leave your computer running overnight and get 10 GL" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then you can "buy" porn for 1 kL or something" ~ ConsciousCode
"In general this exchange won't even be visible to the average user because the time it takes them to navigate to a resource to be requested, their computer will have made them enough to reimburse the virtual server" ~ ConsciousCode
"The only things then which require excess lambdas are things you'd normally pay for, extra services" ~ ConsciousCode
"But even then you're constantly getting more for doing work" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I saw something similar implemented somewhere but can't recall the name so I'm not sure what to search for" ~ k
"general principle seems sound" ~ k
"I'm going hardcore with this" ~ ConsciousCode
"Gonna have .c files which encode the protocol using permanent interfaces" ~ ConsciousCode
"That allows future flexibility" ~ ConsciousCode
"But will only ever be changed by a majority vote" ~ ConsciousCode
"(though I do need botnet protection...)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then on top of that, I'm gonna have a kind of OS which implements higher tier protection rings" ~ ConsciousCode
"And finally there's the userspace, in which threads run and possess lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"The .c file is also used for intrinsics, since I won't be having them as part of the protocol" ~ ConsciousCode
"Think something like add(a, b, k) being at the virtual address 0x100" ~ ConsciousCode
"I didn't get that last part" ~ k
"The address 0x100 is reserved for the function which implements add" ~ ConsciousCode
"For instance" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I should probably actually use thread memory spaces" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say global memory access uses pointers of the form:" ~ ConsciousCode
"struct { int256_t threadid; int256_t off; };" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that'd make intrinsics larger than they really need to be..." ~ ConsciousCode
""Larger" as in "the pointers used to deref them"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unless those are loaded in each thread's memory space...?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Help me come up with a proper noun?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes hi hello" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm making a theme for Visual Studio Code" ~ EnKrypt
"Since the existing ones are piss poor" ~ EnKrypt
"The name can be anything really." ~ EnKrypt
"I just can't come up with names." ~ EnKrypt
"Midnight Bliss" ~ ConsciousCode
"One word pls?" ~ EnKrypt
"Lackadaisy " ~ ConsciousCode
"I always have writers block when it comes to arbitrarily picking proper nouns." ~ EnKrypt
"Another one?" ~ EnKrypt
"That's actually a neat idea in general." ~ EnKrypt
"Take adjective, capitalize first letter." ~ EnKrypt
"k after some thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think I actually have to implement the protocol in C" ~ ConsciousCode
"Having a version number is probably enough" ~ ConsciousCode
"EnKrypt let's remake the internet" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol I'm game." ~ EnKrypt
"Where do we start?" ~ EnKrypt
"Remember how I said I was making a distributed computer" ~ ConsciousCode
"My grandad gave me a peptalk which convinced me to keep going" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's now called The Collective, btw" ~ ConsciousCode
"The lambda system thing, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"Sweet. I like the name too." ~ EnKrypt
"Did you manage to sort out the issues you were having before?" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you remember any specifics?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Transfering computation" ~ EnKrypt
"I didn't understand the problem you were breaking down exactly, but you said something like because of grouping and so, delegation would be a problem" ~ EnKrypt
"I think I thought of a solution in that discussion" ~ ConsciousCode
"So how are you going to decide the initial number of lambdas that wil exist?" ~ EnKrypt
"Well I think I solved that one" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically lambdas can be created from scratch using proof of work" ~ ConsciousCode
"They won't be especially valuable, so it doesn't matter if you can make even a thousand in a second" ~ ConsciousCode
"True, but since there will be no tasks in the beginning, there will be nothing to work on." ~ EnKrypt
"That's fine, it just means the blocks will be slow" ~ ConsciousCode
"See, what I'm thinking is" ~ ConsciousCode
"This way you can get into the network even if you start off broke" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, that'll solve it. I get it." ~ EnKrypt
"So say a network exists, or even you're creating it" ~ ConsciousCode
"You do proof of work to make a lambda" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now you can use this as ransom to join the network" ~ ConsciousCode
"The network gives you a few lambdas and you get booted because your ransom was reached" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then you can get back in easier" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because you have more" ~ ConsciousCode
"Someone basically has to set up a task to be redeemed." ~ EnKrypt
"which by default will be worth 0 lambdas in the beginning." ~ EnKrypt
"No, it's not necessary" ~ ConsciousCode
"Theoretically a block could just be submitting a proof of work" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then that node gets a lambda" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh, so you're not tying it to work that was given by someone else?" ~ EnKrypt
"Submitting a PoW doesn't require being part of the network because they're intrinsically scarce" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, just computation itself" ~ ConsciousCode
"You did a bunch of computation that doesn't matter, here's your reward" ~ ConsciousCode
"Wouldn't that be wasted computation?" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess that's ok." ~ EnKrypt
"As long as the amount of computation is small" ~ EnKrypt
"Initially yes, but it won't be very hard and there might be other ways to make lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm still trying to think through stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, for instance" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you have a command that takes 1 lambda, and the network is configured to have a 1024-node redundancy, you need to batch that with other computations" ~ ConsciousCode
"Otherwise none of the nodes would get anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"(because lambdas are indivisible integers)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I guess there will be wasted computation once you involve redundancy anyway." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, and that's actually fine" ~ ConsciousCode
"Remember, there's wasted computation just by having this be distributed" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since they need to talk to each other etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"But yeah so" ~ ConsciousCode
"There needs to be some way to let a block have just one computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"Naively I could copy the lambda to every participant" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which actually...." ~ ConsciousCode
"That's consistent, isn't it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since they've each done work for the network" ~ ConsciousCode
"But there might be a way to farm infinite lambdas that way" ~ ConsciousCode
"copying the lambda itself or giving a different lambda each?" ~ EnKrypt
"Unless I make lambda task division randomized via hashes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, that was my concern before too." ~ EnKrypt
"If I use hashes as the distribution mechanism, that can only happen if a large majority of the network does it because it's uncontrollable otherwise" ~ ConsciousCode
"In which case it doesn't matter anyway because they rapidly lose value" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh that's another thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"The blockchain can't possibly store every command-to-be" ~ ConsciousCode
"That'd be like generating a kilobyte for every instruction your computer runs" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I not only need some kind of randomized distribution mechanism, which need not be groups, I also need to add a summary mechanism too" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think bitcoin does that with merkle trees or something...?" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that isn't well ordered" ~ ConsciousCode
"What would happen if the merkle hash wasn't H(a . b), but rather H(a ^ b)?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then the order shouldn't matter because ^ is symmetric" ~ ConsciousCode
"But there's still ordering" ~ ConsciousCode
"These need to be globally unordered, but this makes them... recursively unordered?" ~ ConsciousCode
"That is if you swapped leaves it wouldn't have the same root hash" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now defining the ordering itself isn't a problem" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could just order them by their hashes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Rather, the issue here is that ordering them like that would require every node in the network know every branch of the tree, which would have too much bandwidth usage" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok actually backtrack a bit" ~ ConsciousCode
"There IS a problem with copying lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"It causes the lambdas in circulation to be exponentially increasing" ~ ConsciousCode
"There needs to be a mechanism that destroys lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or else lambdas are uncopyable" ~ ConsciousCode
"How can you copy a p2p currency anyway? Can a bitcoin be "copied"?" ~ EnKrypt
"Bitcoins aren't a thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're numbers" ~ ConsciousCode
"As in, you can't point to A bitcoin" ~ ConsciousCode
"Bitcoins only exist as the result of all the network operations since conception" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you have 10 bitcoins because the account you're using was given the remainder of a 2 bitcoin purchase from a 12 bitcoin account" ~ ConsciousCode
"It'd be like if paper/coin money was eliminated entirely, money would become numbers in the bank" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's no place you can point to any particular bill in your bank, it's just a number" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, which is also why hypothetically, if I had access to bank servers, I could change that number and give myself more money" ~ EnKrypt
"So you could "duplicate" bitcoins if the network had some way to give an account twice as much amount as it "should" have" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah, but that's not "copying" though, is it?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's duplicating" ~ ConsciousCode
"The network says I have 1 lambda" ~ ConsciousCode
"I spend that lambda on 2 + 2" ~ ConsciousCode
"If everyone who calculated 2 + 2 got "THAT" lambda, you could say that the lambda was multiplied by that number" ~ ConsciousCode
"So 1024 nodes doing 2 + 2, there's now 1024 lambdas in the network" ~ ConsciousCode
"If any of them then spent their one lambda, it'd multiply just as much" ~ ConsciousCode
"But they wouldn't get THAT lambda." ~ EnKrypt
"They'd get a lambda." ~ EnKrypt
"Whatever, you get what I mean" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just realized that I can't just summarize the computations because other nodes need to know the results" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I could batch computations and merkle that..." ~ ConsciousCode
"So you could have the summary, and the result." ~ EnKrypt
"Remember what I said" ~ ConsciousCode
"If the blockchain has the results in it, it'd be like generating a kilobyte for every instruction your computer runs" ~ ConsciousCode
"You'd get exabytes in seconds" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess the blockchain is just meant to be proof that the current block is valid/not a sham" ~ ConsciousCode
"I actually kind of like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"It means that you can have tons of computation per block and don't have to be slowed down by reaching consensus" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the next member the task needs to be delegated to, needs to know the previous computation's results though right?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, but the hash can be used to prove that a result sent to a new node is the correct result" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need to incentivize computing long strings of sequential instructions" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I also need to make sure you can't choose what instructions you want to run arbitrarily" ~ ConsciousCode
"Assign nodes to threads" ~ ConsciousCode
"H(block + node) ~ thread id?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need to establish some relationship between the hash and the id" ~ ConsciousCode
"Without trashing the size of the space..." ~ ConsciousCode
"And in a way that won't fuck over threads with bad luck" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is that doable?" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't think it is" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not for technical reasons but because even if I could get that, it'd have latency issues" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nodes can only perform computations if they have all the data relevant to the computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"It actually doesn't matter if you can choose" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since the hashing provides a trivial method of verifying that your node is full of shit" ~ ConsciousCode
"The previous is a big problem" ~ ConsciousCode
"We now have a network of random data which needs to go to the right nodes..." ~ ConsciousCode
"But in general, that data will be localized since the results of operations tend to be used by those same operations" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok new problem" ~ ConsciousCode
"In this scheme, there's no obvious way to prove that a node did work" ~ ConsciousCode
"A node that did work can verify that another node did work" ~ ConsciousCode
"But there's no way to package that work such that it can be proven that one node deserves compensation" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok actually there is, but it involves a bunch of wasted work" ~ ConsciousCode
"You mean if a member spoofs the result?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, I'm considering results unspoofable" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then as long as you have a result, won't that be proof of work done?" ~ EnKrypt
"More that to receive consensus on computation, a node has to tell other nodes what its result is" ~ ConsciousCode
"And if other nodes know what the result is, they can repackage the result as if they did the work" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok weird idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"Users don't interact directly with this system" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're always remotely controlling threads" ~ ConsciousCode
"So technically, a peer communicating a result should actually be the peer signing a claim that the result is something specific" ~ ConsciousCode
"Isn't that kind of a computation?" ~ ConsciousCode
"So maybe they could offer half their gains to peers to run the computation that says that node actually did it.... no" ~ ConsciousCode
"You're pooling the compensation to distribute in the end?" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh yeah, that's why I was doing grouping" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why not go finish computation > collect reward > pass result" ~ EnKrypt
"But I think I was thinking too much of veid.io" ~ ConsciousCode
"Problem is there's no obvious way to group nodes like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Especially if they could be on opposite sides of the network" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's no reward to collect" ~ ConsciousCode
"The network has to reach consensus" ~ ConsciousCode
"You only own 10 lambdas because everyone agrees you do" ~ ConsciousCode
"When you finish a bit of the task, what's stopping the network from reaching consensus that you deserve compensation?" ~ EnKrypt
"Because any node that sees your result, which you MUST tell them or else they can't know you did it, can then copy your result and claim they got it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Another idea I've been playing with is to make it probabilistic" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say, you can only be compensated for having a result if your id and the final result have some uncommon relationship" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, you can only get a reward if the result is greater than your id" ~ ConsciousCode
"For example" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's not a practical relationship since the probability is 50:50" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can define some sort of relationship based on the mechanism with which that task was assigned to that member" ~ EnKrypt
"But then I wonder how much effort will be spent trying to change the result hash with nonces to get the result you want vs actually doing computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not sure nodes should be assigned tasks" ~ ConsciousCode
"That destroys locality which would make the VM much, MUCH slower" ~ ConsciousCode
"Uhh, I probably misunderstood. Whatever nodes are assigned then" ~ EnKrypt
"They aren't" ~ ConsciousCode
"And actually that's another thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"If the whole network has to reach consensus about every single computation, it won't be especially scalable" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's why I was thinking delegation was important before" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then again again, the lack of proof of work built into this scheme brings out the problems that having a single group in veid.io was supposed to solve" ~ ConsciousCode
"So what I really need is some kind of... local consensus which produces a global consensus" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like a blockchain of blockchains" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could run an arbitrary number of blockchains" ~ ConsciousCode
"So whenever you're looking for the result, you verify the chain" ~ ConsciousCode
"And maybe there could be a larger blockchain that combines the other blockchains in a much more compact way so you don't have to verify the entire blockchain?" ~ ConsciousCode
"> So whenever you're looking for the result, you verify the chain" ~ EnKrypt
"That sounds rad." ~ EnKrypt
"Can you pull it off?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, I need a grouping mechanism...." ~ ConsciousCode
"Having blockchains within blockchains sounds a bit overkill tho." ~ EnKrypt
"What if proof of work was shared?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Say the difficulty is kept relatively low" ~ ConsciousCode
"But still hard enough that it'd take a few minutes for you to find" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or maybe the difficulty scales with the number of signatures on the block" ~ ConsciousCode
"So groups form naturally rather than artificially" ~ ConsciousCode
"And a group is compensated the same" ~ ConsciousCode
"They have a strong incentive to group up even though doing so means they get less" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then this produces hashes which are relatively rare, so it's hard for any individual to replicate" ~ ConsciousCode
"So now I have an arbitrary number of "forks"" ~ ConsciousCode
"How do I get consensus between groups?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not sure what the incentive they had to group up is, but they could just check if that was fulfilled" ~ EnKrypt
"If what was?" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the point is that a block is only valid if it satisfies a proof of work" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the proof of work is less difficult the more signatures you have" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not to mention you essentially have a mining group like with bitcoin" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's already easier by virtue of just more computers hashing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh duh I know" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could make it so your reward only counts if it's joined with the main blockchain" ~ ConsciousCode
"But mining that uses the same scheme as groups, it's easier to mine if you include more blocks" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that doesn't guarantee all blocks will be included..." ~ ConsciousCode
"I assumed in mining once a block was mined, everyone reached a concensus because there would be the most practical way to reach an agreement." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm bastardizing the bitcoin protocol" ~ ConsciousCode
"But basically what I'm doing is forcing rational agents to help each other" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like... if the only way out of a spike pit was to stand on each other's shoulders" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically "I don't get my reward unless I get others their rewards"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you think there's a way to summarize a blockchain so you don't have to read the entire thing to know the end?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't give you a technical answer, because I'd have to understand this technology properly first, but isn't there a metaphorical equivalent of just opening the last page of the book?" ~ EnKrypt
"Also, I'm finally done. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/enkrypt.Theme-Trepid" ~ EnKrypt
"And yes, that's what I want" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or something similar" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe it could be solely in the p2p network" ~ ConsciousCode
"Although then there's a problem" ~ ConsciousCode
"Freeloaders will have a blast with this system..." ~ ConsciousCode
"Since all that really matters is that your signature be included in a block" ~ ConsciousCode
"And other nodes have incentives to let you even if you didn't do work, since it helps hashing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even worse, it's actually somewhat difficult to perform work without actually wasting effort" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since if you have 1000 peers you're grouped with, just one needs to solve the computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"So tragedy of the commons is basically guaranteed here" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe instead groups aren't computing one string of commands but rather are just grouped together for the combined bonus of getting validated" ~ ConsciousCode
"In bitcoin mining, you get rewarded depending on how much you've mined. Can't you apply that here too?" ~ EnKrypt
"Instead of just riding it out for group validation" ~ EnKrypt
"It's generally advantageous to contribute to group validation" ~ ConsciousCode
"The point of group validation is to make it difficult to copy their work without a large effort, at which point you're better off just doing work yourself" ~ ConsciousCode
"Group validation works like bitcoin mining" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is, H(block) > difficulty" ~ ConsciousCode
"If difficulty is sufficiently large, no individual can hope to validate on their own in a reasonable time" ~ ConsciousCode
"So instead, they have to help a group validate" ~ ConsciousCode
"Woh good timing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just work up lol. My sleep cycle is fucked." ~ EnKrypt
"Just woke up too, have a headache" ~ ConsciousCode
"But gotta think now" ~ ConsciousCode
"*Brainstorming intensifies*" ~ EnKrypt
"If peers only have to provide a summary of the result, what incentivizes them to distribute those results?" ~ ConsciousCode
"If they don't, the group won't agree that they need to compensated." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm guessing the results can act as PoW" ~ EnKrypt
"How do you prove that they're freely distributing the results though?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Consensus is reached by summarizing computations, because that's the only way it could possibly work" ~ ConsciousCode
"What do you mean by "freely" distributing?" ~ EnKrypt
"As in any peer can request the result as needd" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can have computations without summarization in sidechains" ~ ConsciousCode
"But those are required for validating the blockchain itself" ~ ConsciousCode
"And validation, as a group effort, means that peers must distribute freely or risk crippling themselves" ~ ConsciousCode
"But in that case I need to make sure that all RAM locations have a random chance of occurring in the block" ~ ConsciousCode
"What does that have to do with RAM locations?" ~ EnKrypt
"Results are RAM, basically" ~ ConsciousCode
"They go to RAM locations" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm abstracting RAM as part of this computation model" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is that right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, intermediate results are registers" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you can get and set RAM" ~ ConsciousCode
"God EnKrypt brainstorm more ):I" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though sorry, I was having a cute political discussion with my grandparents and sister" ~ ConsciousCode

"Basically I was saying the supreme court was correct in saying separate but equal was constitutional, since the premise was that they were separate BUT equal" ~ ConsciousCode
"It was overturned because it was shown non of them were equal" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which I think is because separation and equality are mutually exclusive" ~ ConsciousCode
"And undesirable anyway since it needlessly restricts individual agency" ~ ConsciousCode
"But my gram seemed to think I was saying separate but equal was a good thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"I would consider classification fine. But seperation would range from ok to a big no-no depending on what was being seperating." ~ EnKrypt
"In this case, blacks having separate everythings" ~ ConsciousCode
"Different bathrooms, drinking fountains, hotels, schools, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's retarded" ~ EnKrypt

"It's crazy that this was just 50 years ago" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe it was just a really ugly baby." ~ EnKrypt
"All newborns are ugly :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah but apparently it being yours can make it seem cuter." ~ EnKrypt
"Maybe it was so ugly, it transcended that effect" ~ EnKrypt
"They look like freshly made orcs" ~ ConsciousCode
"It wasn't the mother" ~ ConsciousCode
"It was the nurse" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah m8 I would throw up too." ~ EnKrypt
"Still not racist though" ~ EnKrypt
"The point was she'd already been through a ton of births and had no problems" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the baby being black made it different in her mind for some reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"I actually really like what black people look like" ~ ConsciousCode
"That literally cannot be proved" ~ EnKrypt
"Sexy black men.. mmmmm" ~ ConsciousCode
"Post hoc ergo properter hoc fallacy" ~ EnKrypt
"And uh, the women too I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well you know what they say: Once you go black you never go back" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah but I think that's a holdover from post-civil rights movement" ~ ConsciousCode
"People getting used to the idea that blacks are people too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Although funny enough" ~ ConsciousCode
"You'd probably be considered black back in the day" ~ ConsciousCode
"It wasn't just Africans, it was anyone with dark skin" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even Irish I think weren't considered white" ~ ConsciousCode
"(even though they had the palest skin, they weren't "aryan" or something)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is that Aryan meme still around?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'D actually be considered black because of the "one drop rule"" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean ffs Indians are supposed to be Aryan. Where's all the white people?" ~ EnKrypt
"Since my grandmother's side of the family had some Hopi Indian" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the Hopi tribe wasn't considered native for awhile because they'd had too many babies with escaped slaves" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I'm like 0.000000005% black" ~ ConsciousCode
"Niggh you prolly more" ~ EnKrypt
"you get me homie" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah yeah whatever" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't consider myself black and I don't identify as white, though I'll put that on paper" ~ ConsciousCode
"Identifying by your race is really sad" ~ ConsciousCode
"It shows that you have nothing to you except the people who were in your genetic line" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can get it for blacks to some extent, it gives a sense of community and comfort" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just think people take it too far" ~ ConsciousCode
"Tribalistic mentalities, they BECOME their identifying label" ~ ConsciousCode
"Tribalism is the source of all problems in the world, EnKrypt" ~ ConsciousCode
"Remember that" ~ ConsciousCode
"It is the true original sin, though you need not feel guilty for having it in the past" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think there should be 3 memory types" ~ ConsciousCode
"Registers, which are the intermediate values stored on the actual blockchain" ~ ConsciousCode
"short-term memory, which is cheaper but might take longer to interact with" ~ ConsciousCode
"And long-term memory, which I still need to think through" ~ ConsciousCode
"It should be the cheapest of all, but MUCH slower" ~ ConsciousCode
"Problem with long term memory is it kind of has to serve double duty" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's long term memory for threads? And it's the filesystem of the VM" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually maybe I should deemphasize the first one" ~ ConsciousCode
"The second one though is tricky, since that means files have to be broadcast to peers rather than threads" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I'll use an IPFS model, or even use IPFS directly but in a more integrated fashion" ~ ConsciousCode
"IPFS is content-addressable" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you have a file which is made of a tree of 512 kb blocks, and each block is addressed by its SHA256 hash" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's an extra problem there though" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's no obvious incentive model for long term memory" ~ ConsciousCode
"RAM can be thought of as collections of RS latches, which can be implemented in the VM" ~ ConsciousCode
"(though it won't be because that'll waste computation)" ~ ConsciousCode
"In that case you can have a direct correlation between preserving a byte of RAM and labmdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe the incentive model should be based on retrieval requests?" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you're explaining for my benefit, I think it's going to be wasted effort. I can help you bounce ideas off better if you just reduced it to metaphors for the time being." ~ EnKrypt
"You're my duck for now" ~ ConsciousCode
"Later on I can get you to code some" ~ ConsciousCode
"What are your preferred languages?" ~ ConsciousCode
"JS, Java, Python" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm starting in JS for maximum portability" ~ ConsciousCode
"Problem with retrieval request incentives is you can prove the peer sent the data, but you can't prove the requester received it" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could tax requesters for not reporting retrievals" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then other peers have incentives to not communicate the data so they can get more money" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's very important though. Otherwise I can use any type of computation and have it be part of the network" ~ EnKrypt
"Explain? What are you responding to" ~ ConsciousCode
"you can't prove the requester received it" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"You don't need to prove it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh my bad. I misread it as "requested it"" ~ EnKrypt
"All you need to do is set up the incentives so it's unreasonable to expect a failure to send other than network failurse" ~ ConsciousCode
"Purposeful failure, that's it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which it already kind of has" ~ ConsciousCode
"Your own reward becomes easier to verify if other nodes have the data they need to compute" ~ ConsciousCode
"So data distribution is implicitly desirable" ~ ConsciousCode
"That means you can't be incentivized for holding that RAM specifically, or holding a lot of it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is technically fine at smaller scales, but at larger scales that limits the network redundancy" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could use filecoin's scheme though" ~ ConsciousCode
"Make blocks easier to mine or possible to mine based on the node's access to a random block of RAM" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that has issues of having the majority of random challenges be referencing invalid RAM" ~ ConsciousCode
"Filecoin stores files using incremented ids" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can technically do that" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if I use thread ids, that'd be a waste of space, right? Since they'll basically always have a few dozen bytes of 0s" ~ ConsciousCode
"What other ids can you use?" ~ EnKrypt
"Well I could hash them, but then they aren't contiguous" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or I could use a variable length encoding" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or I could make it a lookup table of sorts, with 0 -> ab4822f194e" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that would take extra space and would have to be maintained as a separate structur" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even worse, with all of these I fully expect threads to be abandoned all the time" ~ ConsciousCode
"If they stop and are never used again, but have allocated RAM from the network, the id corresponding to their RAM now goes to waste" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then the challenges mean threads have no fiscal responsibility over their memory as a resource" ~ ConsciousCode
"Retrieving memory from RAM is actually an instruction" ~ ConsciousCode
"So using RAM will always cost something" ~ ConsciousCode
"But should nodes be compensated for maintaining RAM?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll leave it up to the thread" ~ ConsciousCode
"The thread can issue challenges of its own, basically a "hey is this memory still there?" message" ~ ConsciousCode
"A thread need not deploy these, which risks lowering utility of maintenance to the point of the memory being dropped" ~ ConsciousCode
"And they can ping as often as they need to" ~ ConsciousCode
"So some memory which isn't very important or is used more than others might be pinged very infrequently" ~ ConsciousCode
"While important but infrequently used memory would be pinged periodically" ~ ConsciousCode
"So will that pinging and retreival be compensated for?" ~ EnKrypt
"They're instructions" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like addition tc" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you might have something like" ~ ConsciousCode
"bigcomputation(0 1 2 FORK(PING(23), continueserver))" ~ ConsciousCode
"As instructions, they have an associated lambda cost" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"PING shouldn't terminate, it should call a continuation with a bool that says whether or not the memory's still there" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's actually a problem with that though" ~ ConsciousCode
"PING depends on the states of every peer in the network..." ~ ConsciousCode
"havemem?0 | havemem?1 | havmem?2 | ... | havmem?peers" ~ ConsciousCode
"A peer only gets compensation if PEER returns 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"If a block goes by without a solution for PEER being submitted, PEER is implicitly called with 0" ~ ConsciousCode
"er, PING not PEER" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol right. PEER got me confused and I assumed it was just another thing that went over my head." ~ EnKrypt
"And yeah, that makes sense" ~ EnKrypt
"Is there any way someone could game this system by artificially generating instructions that only do PING so he can farm lambdas?" ~ EnKrypt
"Fuck this, I've decided VS Code is an editor for utter hipsters." ~ EnKrypt
"Syntax highlighting is subpar for the language it boasts support for." ~ EnKrypt
"No proper remote ftp support" ~ EnKrypt
"Document map/minimap doesn't even exist, not even as an extension" ~ EnKrypt
"No, PING doesn't give you lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though there still needs to be a way to generate them" ~ ConsciousCode
"> As instructions, they have an associated lambda cost" ~ EnKrypt
"As in the thread making PING calls is losing lambdas every time it does it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh. But isn't that incentive for not making PING calls then?" ~ EnKrypt
"The incentive for making PING calls is for a thread to incentivize peers to keep their data around" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just had a weird thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe it isn't a bad thing that a currency has a worst-case exponential curve?" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you reward anyone who proves they did useful work for the network, that value that they hold will represent a unit of that useful work" ~ ConsciousCode
"They've essentially converted their computing time into a commodity in that moment, which is a commodity which can be redeemed" ~ ConsciousCode
"I actually want the network to have minimal redundancy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok new thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"H(f(...)) > difficulty" ~ ConsciousCode
"Every single node performs this on every transaction individually" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not the same computation f, but rather different instructions" ~ ConsciousCode
"The idea being that since there's going to be so much stuff generated by the blockchain itself, nodes don't actually have time to try to rip each other off because by the time they do they could've generated a legit proof which has no qualms against it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then there could be a second tier of nodes, auditors" ~ ConsciousCode
"These are nodes which aggregate all the proofs of useful work from its peers and summarizes it in some kind of merkle tree structure" ~ ConsciousCode
"And of course auditors will be constantly watching each other to see if they're cheating" ~ ConsciousCode
"This provides a locality of verification but acts as a global proof of legitimacy" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then of course auditors agree on the final block which serves as the "main" chain" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok new realization" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is the blockchain structure itself even necessary?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Especially in a system like what I'm designing where past states are best left forgotten" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, with bitcoin it makes sense, you're dealing with a bunch of self-interested agents and everyone who joins wants to make sure they're not being fucked with because there's no culpability" ~ ConsciousCode
"But with the Collective, I need joining to be near costless, I'm able to assign culpability to nodes, and most of the states are worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
"So any new node joining has a good reason to think that what its peers are telling it is legit" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I suppose having some lossy summary would make that better" ~ ConsciousCode
"What's really needed is a state transition per thread" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since all process interaction is done on a per-process level" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say, you don't need to know the entire state transition of the entire internet" ~ ConsciousCode
"You just need to know the state transitions of the process you're accessing" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need CS-math help" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have a suspicion that I can make a URISC using some tensor operation, the tensor product? But I'm having a hard time understanding how it works or if it's "turing complete" (given some executing environment)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have literally no idea what are you talking about" ~ k
"Ultra Reduced Instruction Set" ~ ConsciousCode
"(and stop treating me as some kind of math guru please)" ~ k
"I'm thinking tensor product can be used to make a single-instruction, turing complete computing architecture" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you know the most maths here and it's fun to imagine you as the wizened mathemagician of the cave D:" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also you're around most so" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you don't know? Not even if tensors are universal function approximators? :<" ~ ConsciousCode
"nope, sorry" ~ k
"Ok k non-math question" ~ ConsciousCode
"(I got someone else for it)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or EnKrypt_" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need a programmer ;_;" ~ ConsciousCode
"u'r a programmer, pi" ~ k
"Ok I kinda got something going" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I wanted someone to bounce ideas off of" ~ ConsciousCode
"So again, I'm designing this distributed computing platform called The Collective" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unlike bitcoin and friends, I have to avoid wasted computation as much as possible because it's /for/ computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I'm trying to formalize something I'll call Proof of Populous" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say, a probabilistic proof that a computation is more likely to have been done by a group than by an individual" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think proof of work already satisfies this but requires more work than I can justify" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need a linear relationship between difficult and claimed network size?" ~ ConsciousCode
"*difficulty" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think H/BP satisfies that, with H = hash power (H/s), B = desired block/s, and P = # peers" ~ ConsciousCode
"That gives H/block" ~ ConsciousCode
"Problem there is that doesn't constitute a good proof" ~ ConsciousCode
"For instance assuming average hash power is 10e6, we want 1e6 blocks per second (~1 batched CPU cycle) and we have 2000 peers" ~ ConsciousCode
"That yields 0.0005, so there's actually no difficulty associated with it" ~ ConsciousCode
"The difficulty should get larger with every peer..." ~ ConsciousCode
"that sound impossible to me, there is no observable difference between individual and colluding group, except that processing power isn't free" ~ k
"A GPU is indistinguishable from a collective of CPUs working together of the same number of cores" ~ ConsciousCode
"but that leads to usual proof-of-work scheme that doesn't distinguish between number of peers, only their processing power counts" ~ k
"The point here is to make a task so difficult that it's unreasonable to assume an adversary performed it rather than a collective" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which yes, PoW satisfies" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I could make that scalable..?" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's 0 verification of the most recent block" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the next block's hash of the last block is that + nonce" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the more difficult the hash, the more likely it is that a collective found it" ~ ConsciousCode
"And miners would want to include the best hash possible, even if it rewards someone else more, since it makes their work more likely to be considered valid" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is even nicer when I consider that the sheer number of computations involved here requires that the blockchain not be a single chain, but rather a DAG" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because a single chain would explode in size very quickly, as the more it's used the faster it'll make more data" ~ ConsciousCode
"Data which is unnecessary for 99% of the user-server interactions" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then there's nothing which tells a miner to stop" ~ ConsciousCode
"They have to stop eventually or they'll never be compensated, but there's no point of diminishing returns..." ~ ConsciousCode
"I could limit block size but that'd incentivize hoarding the best transactions?" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, miners don't get their reward from the transactions" ~ ConsciousCode
"(sorry you're a duck for a bit, stop me if you see a problem in my thinking please)" ~ ConsciousCode
"in bitcoin they did collect fees from the transactions, though" ~ k
"Yes but my model's... weird" ~ ConsciousCode
"Remember, processes own money and continuously use it to exist" ~ ConsciousCode
"So those aren't so much transactions as work-to-be-done-by-the-system" ~ ConsciousCode
"No I'm wrong" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're basically transactions, sorry" ~ ConsciousCode
"So they do get rewarded for those" ~ ConsciousCode
"Each computation could be done by someone else" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's technically separate" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or is that undesirable?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean then the system has to compensate miners as well as computers as separate classes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which adds to currency bloat" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think it's fine if miners = computers, yes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Operations are relatively cheap so that allows nodes to collect their efforts into one place without having to have extra network overhead" ~ ConsciousCode
"So we now have two "classes" which hopefully won't be mutually exclusive" ~ ConsciousCode
"So there ARE miners and computers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Miners look for hashes which validate the last block" ~ ConsciousCode
"Computers collect their computations together into a block along with validations of the last block" ~ ConsciousCode
"So what should the reward function be for miners?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Naively I'd say log2(hash), but that isn't a smooth reward function" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if it got "too difficult", rational nodes would get lazy and just not try at all because any effort that doesn't jump the whole gap is worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is that fine though.....????" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok probably" ~ ConsciousCode
"By the time it's getting to that level of difficulty it's unreasonable for an adversary to attempt it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then again again, they should probably be rewarded relative to the work performed, which this doesn't satisfy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lambdas are virtually worthless here" ~ ConsciousCode
"So 2x difficult = +1 lambda isn't fair" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess it should just be maxhash - hash" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the smaller the hash, the more reward one gets" ~ ConsciousCode
"That needs to be scaled some because.. mm" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh yeah, for the average computer that'd be 10e6 lambdas, which is insane" ~ ConsciousCode
"In just a second" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it could easily get larger, especially with many nodes working" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess it has to be discounted per peer" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeh, so (maxhash - hash)/peer" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you have 1000 peers it's 1000x more difficult to get the same.... No that doesn't follow" ~ ConsciousCode
"What's the relationship there?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Really sorry for talking your eyes off btw :I" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't really give you any heplful hints; I'd probably have to review your conv with EnKrypt to get any idea how things are supposed to be" ~ k
"Make it ducK" ~ ConsciousCode
"But yes k, you're seeing THE FUTURE being made!" ~ ConsciousCode
"I WILL REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY WE COMPUTE HAAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHA" ~ ConsciousCode
"THEY LAUGHED, BUT I'LL SHOW THEM" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'LL SHOW THEM ALL" ~ ConsciousCode
"MWUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm weirdly manic today" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok so legit question here actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because I don't do statistics very well" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you have (maxhash - hash)/peer, does that mean that it's peerx as hard to get a hash with the same value as if you were by yourself?" ~ ConsciousCode
"A hash's inverted value is basically equal to its rarity (when scaled by maxhash)" ~ ConsciousCode
"So a hash that's 2x smaller is 2x harder to get" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since 0.... is 2x rarer than 00..." ~ ConsciousCode
"you mean c in P(hash<c), right?" ~ ducK
"Ok yes I think that follows" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where c is the difficulty?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm using an inverted model because it's more intuitive" ~ ConsciousCode
"P(hash > d)" ~ ConsciousCode
"P(hash < d)" ~ ConsciousCode
"P(hash > d)" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the higher d is, the harder it is to find such a hash" ~ ConsciousCode
"As related to bitcoin's model of difficulty, this is inverted afaik" ~ ConsciousCode
"P(hash < 0) = 0" ~ ConsciousCode
"P(hash < maxhash) = 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"yes, the lower the P the harder to get" ~ ducK
"(almost yes, P(hash<=maxhash) = 1)" ~ ducK
"Right, right" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if the difficulty is 0, it should be 100%" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want a direct 1:1 correlation between the words and the meaning" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since bitcoin has difficulty compared that way, which is less intuitive IMO" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is to say lower difficult = harder to get" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why do I keep missing y" ~ ConsciousCode
"okay, iiuc you called it "hash value" ("basically equal to its rarity") above, thats why I asked for clarification" ~ ducK
"(because unless hash isn't fucked then every concrete value is equally hard to get and pretty much in the impossible range)" ~ ducK
"Yeah, individually anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is why it's comparing sets rather than individual values" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where > hash is selecting the set of all numbers larger than the current hash" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok off topic" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just a funny thing I've noticed" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like I said before, lambdas are expected to be virtually worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since adding two numbers is something your computer does billions of times a second" ~ ConsciousCode
"And yet I intend this to be used as a kind of currency" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it'll be like the Zimbabwe dollar, where prices are given in gigalambdas etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now lambdas are also being designed to be created and destroyed, so its market value should fluctuate even then" ~ ConsciousCode
"Meaning that the best way to get a stable market value is to go an order of magnitude or two higher so you throw away enough digits" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk, just a funny thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh, and then it's also funny to note that this is basically the opposite of bitcoin" ~ ConsciousCode
"opposite? how" ~ ducK
"Bitcoin has a limited count but is infinitely divisible, so it's deflationary" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lambdas are integers so the minimum is 0 by definition" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the system can have arbitrarily large numbers of them" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's inflationary" ~ ConsciousCode
"VERRRRRY inflationary" ~ ConsciousCode
"(at least looking at the individual units)" ~ ConsciousCode
"(which is like looking at $1/1e9 to see market fluctuations and concluding the dollar is unstable)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Bitcoin's culture of one of performing very few extreme computations" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whereas this is one of performing trillions of not-very-extreme computations" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's like looking at an aeons-old giant and a swarm of gnats" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok k new inquiry" ~ ConsciousCode
"First off I'm going to call this structure the blockplait" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since it's not a chain, it's more like a billion threads being interleaved at random" ~ ConsciousCode
"So given this structure, a DAG validated by hashes of increasing difficulty, do you think plaits should be rejected for having computations that were already performed?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since all nodes are going to be performing their own selection of the required computations, overlaps are almost guaranteed" ~ ConsciousCode
"So rejecting repeated computation could be a huge slowdown" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it also makes it harder (impossible?) to say who "deserves" compensation for the computation, or even tell that it was repeated in the first place" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like I could say something arbitrary, the reward is given to the older computation, and at equal heights it's the one with th highest hash" ~ ConsciousCode
"I was about to say that has collision possibilities but that's actually considered "so unlikely that we'll wait for the sun to die out first"" ~ ConsciousCode
"In which case sure they both get it I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"this doesn't seem right, replay attacks" ~ ducK
"Yeah that's the problem I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's non-trivial to assert that a computation is only done once" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok so let's start with an extreme case" ~ ConsciousCode
"Assume everything worked out and no attacks etc, so the blockplait is ~1 billion blocks at maximum depth" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or minimum depth, whatever" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now an attacker wishes to take credit for a computation done near the beginning of time, which presumably all other nodes have forgotten about" ~ ConsciousCode
"What information would need to be included in the proof-of-useful-work would make this attack immediately obvious?" ~ ConsciousCode
"So first, I'm having every computation come with a list of assertions which are required for validity" ~ ConsciousCode
"This wasn't intended to solve this problem, it was supposed to be a way of validating the system's current state without parsing the entire plait" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which of course is not just difficult but even impossible as most nodes will likely forget really old blocks out of necessity" ~ ConsciousCode
"bbl ~20m, don't break my beak off when I'm afk" ~ ducK
"I'll stop ducking for now then" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe use an editor" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've figured it out" ~ ConsciousCode
"1 process per block, any number of state transitions" ~ ConsciousCode
"This allows the whole block to be destroyed without destroying too much effort" ~ ConsciousCode
"It does mean that overlapping state transitions make invalid plaits, and thus the work of miners to validate forked plaits is wasted" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I think this is unavoidable and possibly incentivizes closer communication or better validation anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"k I feel weird" ~ ConsciousCode
"My heart is burning but it doesn't feel like pain" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's like... my heart's become a sun which radiates happiness/passion? but so much that it's painful to look at, if that makes sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like it's super weird, I feel almost like I'm on the verge of tears somehow" ~ ConsciousCode
"uh oh, I have no idea, but you probably should ask someone about that" ~ ducK
"I'll say it's the universe telling me to do this shit ( '-')" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's actually really beautiful how perfectly this idea is fitting togethr" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually it's probably because I moved up to 2 pills of concerta" ~ ConsciousCode
"Last time I was there I had weird manic episodes because my brain wasn't used to it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you think I should make validations per-edge or per-block?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah nvm, gotta be per edge" ~ ConsciousCode
"Otherwise duplication of the validation would lead to difficulties sorting out ambiguities" ~ ConsciousCode

"But then again, I've only seen it spelled in hindi" ~ EnKrypt
"And hindi to english translations can have some weird vowel endings to accentuate the different accents" ~ EnKrypt
"Anyway guessing Amos > Atma?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I actually like both." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, I also used "amos" in a talk with my mom about souls" ~ ConsciousCode
"Trying to explain what was basically the atma" ~ ConsciousCode
"I love the idea too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not because it has empirical truth to it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But rather it has a kind of metaphysical truth, in the sense that it's "true" insofar as you think of your self as the concept of experience" ~ ConsciousCode
"So in a sense "you" (the experience/experiencer) won't ever go away because you exist in all things" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's like animism 2.0" ~ ConsciousCode
"Of course this isn't reincarnation or an afterlife or whatever" ~ ConsciousCode
""You" as the experiences/personality ceases to exist probably" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unless the multiverse exists, in which case it's actually impossible to die" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since there'll always be a universe in which there's a consciousness with exactly the same history who didn't die when "you" did" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sorry I'm going really far off topic" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ah, that's called Quantum suicide I think" ~ EnKrypt
"Can you check for issues in the spec?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's fascinating as fuck imo" ~ ConsciousCode
"I sometimes forget that I haven't explained some things when I go forward" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I need you to make sure you understand with one read-through" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you write all of this?" ~ EnKrypt
"And re: quantum suicide, it's essentially the anthropic principle + oblivion" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can't experience being dead because "you" doesn't exist" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the only meaningful notion of "you" is one which is alive still" ~ ConsciousCode
"Obviously afterlives ruin this" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it's fun to think about" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right. Being dead is mostly a state than an experience." ~ EnKrypt
"Well idk, some belief systems claim to experience death too." ~ EnKrypt
"Death is either an afterlife or an oblivion" ~ ConsciousCode
"more like no experience" ~ EnKrypt
"Death = {} ∪ ~{}" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where {} is nonexistence" ~ ConsciousCode
"In what way can you experience no experience?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, set theory" ~ ConsciousCode
"We don't have to though" ~ EnKrypt
"Just semantically classifying it doesn't count as experiencing it" ~ EnKrypt
"But imo quantum suicide is more likely than afterlife." ~ EnKrypt
"What I mean is "being dead is mostly a state than an experience" implies that being dead is to some extent also an experience" ~ ConsciousCode
"As far as unprovable theories go in terms of likelihood" ~ EnKrypt
"Yet in this train of logic we're treating death as the lack of experience" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh, in that case I agree. It can't be." ~ EnKrypt
"New idea: reincarnation is equivalent to oblivion until the moment there exists a "you" who remembers that they existed as you" ~ ConsciousCode
"Reason being, even accounting for the supernatural aspects of reincarnation (remembering impossible details etc), that's epistemologically equivalent to psychic children "downloading" the thoughts and memories of dead people" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it only becomes meaningful to consider someone "you" when they have your memories and a sense of continued identity" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though some cases do have that, it's usually lost after childhood" ~ ConsciousCode
"In which case "you" as the ex-reincarnation has ceased to exist" ~ ConsciousCode
"Huh, but all this would mean though is that reincarnation just can't be proved: because you'd have to have someone else's memories to realize you've reincardnated." ~ EnKrypt
"Well do remember we're talking about metaphysical ideas" ~ ConsciousCode
"And it would also be possible that we have to live out everyone's lives." ~ EnKrypt
"Metaphysical means it's beyond empiricism" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, I get it, we're far beyond proving stuff" ~ EnKrypt
"So the only conclusions we can make are those based in logic given premises" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't want an afterlife tho tbh" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm pretty exhausted as it is." ~ EnKrypt
"I think a few devils pricking your bum will rile you back up" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's another fascinating perspective though" ~ ConsciousCode
"That the reason we're here at all, and that evil exists, is because we as "god" are bored out of our mind from eternity" ~ ConsciousCode
"So we forget that we exist as one and separate into individual experiences" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then eventually rejoin to collect our thoughts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sounds like the opposite of solipsism" ~ EnKrypt
"They have a common thread somewhere" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well sounds like a shitty way to do shit because those individual experiences seem get a lot fucking bored too." ~ EnKrypt
"It's a different kind of bored" ~ ConsciousCode
"Consider it like this then; given eternity and infinite possibility, everything will eventually happen" ~ ConsciousCode
"And of course by "bored" I'm anthropomorphizing it" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's like a rainbow table of inifinite length?" ~ EnKrypt
"If youstart out with imafag, you'll eventually get imafagimafag" ~ EnKrypt
"Wish I could choose which part of the rainbow table I was in" ~ EnKrypt
"You're already in it but I understand by "you" here you're referring to your personality/experience" ~ ConsciousCode
"But in that case you wouldn't really be you" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since you'd have a different experience" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, we talked about that before" ~ EnKrypt
"Consider that there IS a you like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"A you who was here but then suddenly found yourself there" ~ ConsciousCode
"True, but it's frustrating. Knowing that our current model of the universe allows there to be all kinds of versions where you're rolling in money and bitches, but nah son you gun be stuck here." ~ EnKrypt
"That's true too." ~ EnKrypt
"You just need a kind of... enlightenment, I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean I'm cheating here because I have meds to balance my brain" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually, if that's happen, I'd prolly freak out and think I was hallucinating/having a stroke" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't want meds." ~ EnKrypt
"But it's a kind of infinite patience founded in experience the present as an ephemeral eternity" ~ ConsciousCode
"*experiencing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Meh, I don't even wholeheartedly believe the present exists." ~ EnKrypt
"It depends on how you view it" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can justify only the present existing, or everything but the present" ~ ConsciousCode
"Never thoght of the former" ~ EnKrypt
"But it makes just as much sense" ~ EnKrypt
"It's a focus thing I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"Myopia vs hyperopia" ~ ConsciousCode
"And this is why philosophy is important" ~ ConsciousCode
"It isn't useless wishy washy stuff, it's the attitude of questioning everything and thinking through things rationally and critically" ~ ConsciousCode
"It can very easily slip out of the rational zone though. Especially with topics involving confirmation bias/wishful thinking" ~ EnKrypt
"Or theories in general formed by a want for things you know you can't really have." ~ EnKrypt
"Then you're going outside of philosophy though" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's like saying math stops being rational when you say 1 = 2" ~ ConsciousCode
"It stops being consistent. And consistency is a part of math, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"In fact, fun fact:" ~ ConsciousCode
"The reason paradoxes are so bad in rational systems is because proving a paradox is equivalent to proving all things" ~ ConsciousCode
"1 = 2 also implies 10 = 3" ~ ConsciousCode
"And all other such combinations" ~ ConsciousCode
"So, how's the spec?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Any questions?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wouldn't call that bad though. Paradoxes are usually a sign of some underlying inconsistency around which some concept was built." ~ EnKrypt
"Still reading. It's a bit long" ~ EnKrypt
"Any questions yet?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh hey enKrypt" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you finish reading that paper?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or have any questions?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I went to one of those developers meet thingy today." ~ EnKrypt_
"What are those?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even they were pretty excited about IPFS" ~ EnKrypt_
"Did you tell them about Amos? :o" ~ ConsciousCode
"Didn't get a chance." ~ EnKrypt_
"Too much IPFS? lol" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well I'm going to try to make Amos interoperable with IPFS" ~ ConsciousCode
"But a lot of them are into the p2p deal, so I think they'd be pretty interested if I explained." ~ EnKrypt_
"That's nice." ~ EnKrypt_
"I've even posted some ideas into their github which would make that easier" ~ ConsciousCode
"And would be better for them too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Have the issues recieved attention?" ~ EnKrypt_
"https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/153" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah a little bit" ~ ConsciousCode
"Huh, well if someone from the people actually maintaining ipfs expresses interest, you could make that implementation yourself and then make a pull request." ~ EnKrypt_
"Contributing to IPFS would make for a strong resume by itself." ~ EnKrypt_
"Not that kind of interoperable unfortunately" ~ ConsciousCode
"The protocols have to be different" ~ ConsciousCode
"But the standards can be the same" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which means the protocols could have crosstalk" ~ ConsciousCode
"I spent all of yesterday working on making a side library just for managing byte formats for the protocols" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which was annoying" ~ ConsciousCode
"But now it's all pretty and I don't have to worry about it anymore" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which protocols?" ~ EnKrypt_
"This is something that could've been fixed if I had a team" ~ ConsciousCode
"Amos' protocols" ~ ConsciousCode
"Message and block formats primarily" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why not start a slack or something and get people interested?" ~ EnKrypt_
"I think /g/ might even get you some traction" ~ EnKrypt_
"It didn't occur to me that you could do that without having a team already" ~ ConsciousCode
"But real quick, are there any cons to that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Posting on /g/ specifically" ~ ConsciousCode
"Doesn't really matter" ~ ConsciousCode
"People shitting all over your idea" ~ EnKrypt_
"If they're valid I want them shitting on it" ~ ConsciousCode
"A lot of skillful trolls can bullshit while seeming valid." ~ EnKrypt_
"But I think you can deal with that" ~ EnKrypt_
"Ok EnKrypt you can be the first" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also, are you confident that no one can "steal" this?" ~ EnKrypt_
"I mean they could, but it'd be a lot of work" ~ ConsciousCode
"I fully expect forks after a few months" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if it's done fast enough that shouldn't happen" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also I don't stand to gain anything specifically from this" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it doesn't matter if someone steals it provided they do it in a way that's as good as or better than my original idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"Imo though, if someone more experienced than you did try to replicate this, they'd still be slower because you've already thought of most pitfalls along the way " ~ EnKrypt_
"So... email?" ~ ConsciousCode
"arvind@enkrypt.in" ~ EnKrypt_
"Ok I need a shower" ~ ConsciousCode
"Only problem with /g/ is that 4chan doesn't tend to appreciate shilling" ~ ConsciousCode
"As long as you're upfront about the shilling and mention it's something you're building." ~ EnKrypt_
"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/4wmd06/criticism_and_programmers_wanted_for_new/" ~ ConsciousCode
"How's this?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah reddit's nice." ~ EnKrypt_
"But idk if you're in a good enough subreddit" ~ EnKrypt_
"Upvoted btw" ~ EnKrypt_
"I don't use reddit, so idk what subreddit would be good" ~ ConsciousCode
" /r/bitcoin is huge, but you can't use that for obvious reasons." ~ EnKrypt_
"It'd have to be an altcoin or tech subreddit" ~ ConsciousCode
"Golld old /r/programming?" ~ EnKrypt_
"Do they mind shilling?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've seen a fuckload of people linking to their own blog posts there" ~ EnKrypt_
"EnKrypt JQ k" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have need for my minions" ~ ConsciousCode
"YEYEYEYYEYEYYEYEYE" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I'm back on track and I had a thought" ~ ConsciousCode
"So thus far I've been thinking of the soft memory of Amos to be a big address space, like you'd get with a low level language" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I just realized that it might be better to use a database structure, since that's going to be used extremely often and will probably be easier for clients to handle" ~ ConsciousCode
"Big address space sounds like it would exist on the RAM. And memory meant for random access sounds intended for this." ~ EnKrypt
"Unless your db structure would also exist on RAM" ~ EnKrypt
"By "database structure" I mean like key:value pairs" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or maybe this has nothing to do with RAM." ~ EnKrypt
"Soft memory is RAM-like" ~ ConsciousCode
"The thing is having a big address space isn't amenable to the kind of consensus protocol used by Amos" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm guessing one gives better performance, the other gives better ease of handling?" ~ EnKrypt
"Since it requires having to verify arbitrary chunks of data rather than the semantics of that data" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's easier to assert that key:val is an entry than it is to say addresses x to y have this data" ~ ConsciousCode
"And address space would mean that they'd have to implement their own data structures, which would tend to be hard to verify because of the loosey-goosey memory access" ~ ConsciousCode
"pros or address space?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm thinking of this as like how NES games do all sorts of insane hacks like splitting instructions down the middle of an instruction for another instruction" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where the address space isn't used like an address:entry but rather as a contiguous array which is mutated at will" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess technically address space would use less real RAM, but I think that's probably a moot point" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then yeah, db structure sounds intuitive" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, and that makes other things easier too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Exported interfaces can have an implicit name based on its hash" ~ ConsciousCode
"Functions have implicit names" ~ ConsciousCode
"And since they're reified, I can set explicit permissions per-entry" ~ ConsciousCode
"Good work team" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok next question" ~ ConsciousCode
"How big should entries be?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Entries for what?" ~ EnKrypt
"The db/table" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well the best way to determine this kind of stuff is to have an example" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I think the first Amos process will be a chat program" ~ ConsciousCode
"Soz, fell asleep there." ~ EnKrypt
"How would you make it be a chat app?" ~ EnKrypt
"The point of Amos is serverless websites" ~ ConsciousCode
"Consensus replacing authority" ~ ConsciousCode
"A truly decentralized internet" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sounds a bit like freedom.js" ~ EnKrypt
"That's meant for web apps, not websites" ~ ConsciousCode
"Aren't all websites technically also web apps?" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess the scope of Amos is just bigger" ~ ConsciousCode
"It aims to do more" ~ ConsciousCode
"freedom.js AFAIK just lets users connect to each other, which still requires server handshakes and only works with small scale consensus" ~ ConsciousCode
"k and EnKrypt pst" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just wanted to brainstorm a weird Lisp idea I had" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is on that treats all data as streams" ~ ConsciousCode
"Constants are infinite streams of that constant, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"We spoke about something similar a while back." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't remember what that was about, but is this connected?" ~ EnKrypt
"I think it's the same thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"1 -> 1 1 1 1 1 ..." ~ ConsciousCode
"(+ 1 2) -> (+ 1 2) (+ 1 2) (+ 1 2) ..." ~ ConsciousCode
"Are constant streams blocking?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'd assume (+ 1 2) would be 3" ~ EnKrypt
"And 1 and 2 would wait for next call" ~ EnKrypt
"And I guess they are, but that wouldn't tend to be a factor" ~ ConsciousCode
"'re thinking of making (+ 1 2) itself as a stream?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, lists would probably be infinitely recursive" ~ ConsciousCode
"So (+ 1 2) is th equivalent in another Lisp of (+ 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 ...)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Isn't that invalid syntax?" ~ EnKrypt
"Dude, it's the semantics" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's interesting, but why tho? Isn't it better to just evaluate the expression and give result?" ~ EnKrypt
"You know how Lisp lists work right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"The stuff inside ()?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, but idk what you're expecting (+ 1 2 + 1 2 ..) to do" ~ EnKrypt
"I take it you lack imagination" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since that's a construct you made up" ~ EnKrypt
"struct Cons { struct Atom* car; struct Atom* cdr; };" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yup, I'm dead inside" ~ EnKrypt
"Car has the data, cdr has the link to the next element" ~ ConsciousCode
"Normally in Lisp the end of the list has cdr = NULL" ~ ConsciousCode
"But here, the end of the list has cdr = <address of the first element>" ~ ConsciousCode
"And it has practical use as a stream processing language" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm specifically thinking of this as potentially a kind of data manipulation tool" ~ ConsciousCode
"Got that, but I'm still clearly missing something, since I can't see how (+ 1 2 + 1 2) would have a nice way to handle the second +" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah that's pending" ~ ConsciousCode
"It is possible to detect cycles like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just check for a repeating address and stop" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol alright." ~ EnKrypt
"I thought that was already a thing and didn't get it." ~ EnKrypt
"Tell me more about your data manipulation tool." ~ EnKrypt
"Well I just got a job at my cousin's work, and he's complained about how the industry of data analysis apparently totally lacks tools for manipulating simple data" ~ ConsciousCode
"And he's totally right, afaik there's no Linux utility for manipulating streams arbitrarily" ~ ConsciousCode
"You have to use bash and piping" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hold up. You got a job? That's great. How did that happen?" ~ EnKrypt
"I asked my cousin if his work had an opening and apparently they did" ~ ConsciousCode
"So how will your lisp variant solve manipulating streams?" ~ EnKrypt
"By manipulating them :y" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's supposed to be abstract low level tool?" ~ EnKrypt
"That's once reason why I like lisp in general. It's like legos for devs." ~ EnKrypt
"Before it turns into a nightmare of nested hell." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm feeling kinda weird" ~ ConsciousCode
"hard to think" ~ ConsciousCode
"What kind of feeling?" ~ EnKrypt
"can't xplain" ~ ConsciousCode
"Physical? State of mind?" ~ EnKrypt
"Overexertion, lack of sleep?" ~ EnKrypt
"That was me hitting the keyboard and posting" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it should rally b awrgjwirluqeth" ~ ConsciousCode
"Freudian keyboard smash" ~ EnKrypt
"Do something that doesn't involve much thinking then." ~ EnKrypt
"insert arbitrary distraction here" ~ EnKrypt
"I just tried (setf a '(+ 1 2))(setf (cdddr a) a) in clisp" ~ k
"it hung and ate all my memory" ~ k
"What's setf?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't know lisp" ~ k
"K help me make a new genre of music I call hexwave" ~ ConsciousCode
"how's your Japanese, though?" ~ k
"That's my default boredom project" ~ ConsciousCode
"It uses a 16-note scale/"octave" and nothing but hex digits to communicate a midi-like song" ~ ConsciousCode
"My primary hangup is that I don't know how to play arbitrary music and would rather avoid writing to .wav first" ~ ConsciousCode
"16 sounds super unorthodox" ~ k
"I used libao before" ~ k
"osusume desu" ~ k
"What the fuck" ~ ConsciousCode
"Audacity is freaking the fuck out" ~ ConsciousCode
"I press play and it outputs garbage to my speakers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then I hit stop and it hangs until it's force quit" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok there, now it's working again...." ~ ConsciousCode
"And then it stopped" ~ ConsciousCode
"It looks kind of like it's playing at a much faster rate than it's supposed to" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, if I let it play it eventually stops playing at lightning speed" ~ ConsciousCode
"wanna make $" ~ jq
"I'm sending a guy who might pay you guys to install a u413 on his shared server actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"He should be here soon hopefully" ~ ConsciousCode
"But also yes" ~ ConsciousCode
"oh that is what I am taking about" ~ jq
"Uhh did you tell him (did he tell you) which version of U413 he wants?" ~ EnKrypt
"you want it? " ~ jq
"He's contacting you too?" ~ ConsciousCode
"No I have to leave soon and I'm laaaaazy" ~ ConsciousCode
"python he said" ~ jq
"aka your version " ~ jq
"I suggested he not do Python because I made it ages ago" ~ ConsciousCode
"So PiMaster's repo" ~ EnKrypt
"g2g for now,but do et." ~ jq
"But Chevex's won't work either because it uses mongodb" ~ ConsciousCode
"looking at apartments" ~ jq
"Mongo is easy to set up tbh" ~ EnKrypt
"Unless his server has restrictions" ~ EnKrypt
"It's a shared server, so idk" ~ ConsciousCode
"And like I said I'm feeling super lazy" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you can bring him here, I'll help him out" ~ EnKrypt
"Or I'll try to." ~ EnKrypt
"I've mostly forgotten how we built that thing" ~ EnKrypt
"Terribly :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"IIRC all the commands have their own files and are loaded based on filename" ~ ConsciousCode
"So cmd checks for cmd.py and imports it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah lol. Doing that is really convenient in node." ~ EnKrypt
"Anyway, we should have written a proper module system" ~ EnKrypt
"In node I'd actually avoid that entirely" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol I also remember when we both tried to push code at the same time and some merge conflict messed everything up" ~ EnKrypt
"Going for something more like a standardized command interface that adds new commands" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you just want a modular app running, it's an ok hack." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh hey actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"We could make u413 one of the first Amos processes" ~ ConsciousCode
"It'd be really well suited for that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yfw it dies out like the original." ~ EnKrypt
"But lol yeah I'm for it." ~ EnKrypt
"I got hashing working" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since I'm going away for a bit, maybe you could work on it some?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'd love to, but it'd be like giving a caveman a smartphone." ~ EnKrypt
"nah we just need to see what you can do in the meantime" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's a simple protocol, I just need the framework put together" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I've been having trouble because of motivation and focus issues" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have those things, but I'm not familiar with a lot of that stuff." ~ EnKrypt
"Maybe point me to some resources" ~ EnKrypt
"Because I do want to help" ~ EnKrypt
"I showed you the whitepaper right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"And it looks like you could use some" ~ EnKrypt
"Yup, but you assumed I already knew p2p/blockchain stuff" ~ EnKrypt
"Which I don't." ~ EnKrypt
"Ah ok well it's pretty easy" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have like very shallow surface ideas about them" ~ EnKrypt
"Blockchain is just like an immutable linked list" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you have some B0, B1 refers to H(B0)" ~ ConsciousCode
"B2 refers to H(B1)" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if these hashes have some special rare property, the further down the chain you go the more likely that property is there" ~ ConsciousCode
"EnKrypt I'm guessing this is our guy, and k you might be around too" ~ ConsciousCode
"H() being a hashing function?" ~ EnKrypt
"Ah, well hello." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh hey Conscious, Anthony here." ~ anum
"Curious, did you have a well known u413 handle?" ~ ConsciousCode
"back at that time, it was either anumaz, tree or mazurek" ~ anum
"Those are all pretty cool sounding" ~ ConsciousCode
"mazurek sounds familar." ~ EnKrypt
"I've been using anumaz and tree for the past years, but mazurek was my first ever." ~ anum
"Sounds supernatural" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like an angel or something" ~ ConsciousCode
"I used to play roleplay games and Mazurek was always my last name!" ~ anum
"Reminds me of Melchizidek or whatver" ~ ConsciousCode
"Anyone around here who could help me out installing ConsciousCode's version of u413 on a shared hosting ? :P" ~ anum
"I believe it's written in cgi" ~ EnKrypt
"He says he can even give you ssh/ftp access so it should be easy" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm just lazy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh really? I think it was in django" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah. There's nothing on that host right now" ~ anum
"That makes it even easier then" ~ ConsciousCode
"Don't mind giving out ssh and ftp ahah" ~ anum
"Where's the entry point though?" ~ ConsciousCode
"So what I did is I put all the github files in a folder. I made a sql database with the .sql provided, and I updated the credentials for hostname/username/pw for sql" ~ anum
"Oh yep, you got it" ~ ConsciousCode
"So looks like all you have to do is copy the repo to your host" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think you have to put it in a folder that's recognized by cgi" ~ EnKrypt
"Like in cgi-bin or whatever." ~ EnKrypt
"Then call python api/u413.py" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think what we did was make a custom folder and used a header to enable cg in it" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok listen to EnKrypt he appaerntly still remembers this" ~ ConsciousCode
"Very vaguely though" ~ EnKrypt
"And anum you should also take this as an opportunity to learn Python and make it better" ~ ConsciousCode
"how do you make a custom folder and use a header haha." ~ anum
"mkdir folder-name" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the header is something in .htaccess I'm guessing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well I consulted all my tech friends and they all say Python is the worst thing to use hahah" ~ anum
"It's ok with flask/django" ~ EnKrypt
"It's... good for rapid prototyping of algorithms" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everything else is kind of painful" ~ ConsciousCode
"JS is a much better language IMO" ~ ConsciousCode
"They have their niches." ~ EnKrypt
"But this was back when I had a boner for Python" ~ ConsciousCode
"so I make a folder and put .htaccess in it " ~ anum
"What's in the .htaccess :o" ~ anum
"Oh apparently all that's already in the repo" ~ EnKrypt
"https://github.com/ConsciousCode/u413/blob/master/.htaccess" ~ EnKrypt
"Those lines enable cgi" ~ EnKrypt
"We were really bad at using .gitignore" ~ ConsciousCode
"The first one actually." ~ EnKrypt
"Actually, it's good we didn't." ~ EnKrypt
"You guys are so confusing lmao." ~ anum
"This just uses LAMP + Python" ~ ConsciousCode
"So when you access yoursite.com/api/u413.py" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's called by your scripts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok so this'll be super dupes easy as long as you have Python" ~ ConsciousCode

"Make sure you've done the steps in that ^" ~ EnKrypt
"You already have apache installed" ~ EnKrypt
"And python too probably." ~ EnKrypt
"Just setup the rest" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm so lost" ~ anum
"can you help me out with ssh/ftp lol" ~ anum
"You gotta understand web programming isn't my thing" ~ anum
"I barely know php/html (I'm actually Learning it!)" ~ anum
"Mm alright." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok try this. If it doesn't work, I'll help you out with ssh" ~ EnKrypt
"Run this : sudo a2enmod cgi" ~ EnKrypt
"Not sure I have sudo access, 1 sec." ~ anum
"I do that line in ssh directly, no need to cd anywhere?" ~ anum
"antdup (my username) is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be rpoted." ~ anum
"Do you have access to root?" ~ EnKrypt
"Normally yea..." ~ anum
"Sorry, I meant the root user" ~ EnKrypt
"it's shared hosting" ~ anum
"That could be a problem" ~ EnKrypt
"How much do you pay for this?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Try that command without sudo, see what it says" ~ EnKrypt
"https://www.dreamhost.com/hosting/" ~ anum
"Switch to DigitalOcean dude it's a lot better" ~ ConsciousCode
"I pay $5/mo and have 0 restrictions on what I can do" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah or AWS" ~ EnKrypt
"Use a referral link from me so I can save money :3" ~ ConsciousCode
"And if you signup for github student pack, they literally give you 100$ in credit" ~ EnKrypt
"I'v had trouble getting that for some reason though" ~ ConsciousCode
"running: a2enmod cgi" ~ anum
"says command not found" ~ anum
"https://m.do.co/c/52930d416cd0" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just switched from ipage to dreamhost.." ~ anum
"This'll be your last host" ~ ConsciousCode
"it doesnt look like shared hosting" ~ anum
"oh its a vps" ~ anum
"They make a VM which pretends to be a standalone server" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can do literally anything you want" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is it harder to run a website " ~ anum
"Never did that" ~ anum
"I'm used to just go on ftp and do my shit there" ~ anum
"Please don't lol" ~ ConsciousCode
"As easy as running it from a computer you'd own." ~ EnKrypt
"is Apache and stuff already installed" ~ anum
"I wonder if DO uses kvm internally for their droplets" ~ EnKrypt
"Installing it is easy don't worry" ~ EnKrypt
"and the 5$/mo package is sufficient?" ~ anum
"Lol m8 I'll tell you what all is running on my 5$ droplet" ~ EnKrypt
"nah I trust you, I trust you." ~ anum
"Haha alright" ~ EnKrypt
"Alright I got a deal for you man" ~ anum
"50$ canadian (I'm canadian, sorry) for:" ~ anum
"1) You tell me how to make it so my externet.website domain points to that site with DO" ~ anum
"2) install all the LAMP stuff" ~ anum
"3) install a WORKING version of u413" ~ anum
"That's 2.5k rupee" ~ ConsciousCode
"and 4) tell me a bit how to manage my site" ~ anum
"EnKrypt's a dirty injun" ~ ConsciousCode
"And lives in Hyrule" ~ ConsciousCode
"is 2.5k rupee a lot" ~ anum
"I'll do 1 and 2 for free. I actually love setting servers up" ~ EnKrypt
"And I've got nothing to do for the next hour" ~ EnKrypt
"what abour 3 & 4" ~ anum
"3 and 4 **<" ~ anum
"I'm worried about 3 because I've forgotten how cgi works" ~ EnKrypt
"or any version" ~ anum
"I know there's a node.js version by chevex" ~ anum
"if its any easier" ~ anum
"and point #4 I mean: how to manage my MySQL database/users, where to upload my files online, etc." ~ anum
"Oh, that's easy too." ~ EnKrypt
"I'll help you set up the python repo itself." ~ EnKrypt
"a2enmod should theroetically work" ~ EnKrypt
"It just isn't in your current setup" ~ EnKrypt
"Noob question;" ~ anum
"how do you even access a VPS" ~ anum
"so everything is managed from ssh?" ~ anum
"Commands and stuff, yeah" ~ EnKrypt
"Some people go overboard, install remote display servers" ~ EnKrypt
"I'd say that's a bit too much for just a personal VPS. SSH should be enough" ~ EnKrypt
"And some SFTP client to transfer files." ~ EnKrypt
"a2enmod is a command on my server. So it should also work on your DO server when it's set up." ~ EnKrypt
"so I manage files, MySQL, etc, from ssh?" ~ anum
"that's a bit freaky haha" ~ anum
"never used it before" ~ anum
"except for these u413 attempts" ~ anum
"I use phpmyadmin to manage MySQL" ~ EnKrypt
"I can use that, alright." ~ anum
"I just use mysql" ~ ConsciousCode
"Don't tend to have to touch it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Back when I was a u413 admin I also had a mysql command buuuut" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's hard to monitor data from the command line tho" ~ EnKrypt
"I think that might be a bad idea, since I once accidentally deleted every post" ~ ConsciousCode
"When did that happen lmao" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't even remember commands on u413" ~ anum
"Yeah remember? It was a few days after we started a new u413" ~ ConsciousCode
"I remember I was able to use it so quickly before." ~ anum
"I wanted to edit something I said but accidentally made the condition true for every post" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it edited every post to that edit, so I deleted them all" ~ ConsciousCode
"You guys gonna use it? haha" ~ anum
"Probably gonna post it on reddit" ~ anum
"I might drop by once in a while out of nostalgia." ~ EnKrypt
"I'll buy the 5$ one" ~ anum
"what info do you need" ~ anum
"Do the registration process." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok EnKrypt I'm gone" ~ ConsciousCode
"Tell when you're at the page where they let you select stuff for your droplet like the OS and location and shit" ~ EnKrypt
"Look at the slack in a while, maybe talk to caon" ~ ConsciousCode
"Er, waffles" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's his handle" ~ ConsciousCode
"sec, on phone" ~ anum
"I get Looks like soemthing went wrong" ~ anum
"Ok Im there" ~ anum
"what os, datacenter" ~ anum
"Ubuntu 16.04" ~ EnKrypt
"Pick whatever datacenter sounds convenient" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you have options in 16.04 itself?" ~ EnKrypt
"Idk if 16.04.1 is out" ~ EnKrypt
"yep 16.04.1" ~ anum
"16.04.1 x64 or x32" ~ anum
"add block storage? no right?" ~ anum
"Eh? I don't remember that option." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm on my phone lol" ~ anum
"cant add ssh keys" ~ anum
"You can just set up a password I'm sure" ~ EnKrypt
"its creating" ~ anum
"okay its created" ~ anum
"what do u need" ~ anum
"PM me the IP and root password" ~ EnKrypt
"what is the root password? my digitalocean's ?" ~ anum
"I got it in a email" ~ anum
"Ah, ssh into a fresh droplet is such a nice feeling." ~ EnKrypt
"thanks man for all you're doing" ~ anum
"I appreciate" ~ anum
"It's no problem. I actually like doing initial server setups, and I'd much rather take some time and do it myself than see some of the horrors that people end up with." ~ EnKrypt
"So you're installing Python, LAMP, etc. Pretty much?" ~ anum
"Do you need anything more?" ~ EnKrypt
"Don't think I do. " ~ anum
"Ok, I've set up your own user and disabled root." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm skipping setting up a firewall though you should probably do it later." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok I'll note that down" ~ anum
"Will I be to use like... filezilla... to access my files and manage my website?" ~ anum
"Is that a sftp client?" ~ EnKrypt
"there's the option, yes" ~ anum
"Then it should work." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm on Windows so I use winscp whenever I need to do any of that." ~ EnKrypt
"Keep me updated man :P what you doing now?" ~ anum
"Ok, so your droplet has 512MB of RAM" ~ EnKrypt
"which is ok for light stuff" ~ EnKrypt
"But it can soon become a bottleneck" ~ EnKrypt
"So I enabled swapping." ~ EnKrypt
"whats that " ~ anum
"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04" ~ anum
"Swapping is when a computer uses hard drive as RAM when your regular RAM gets full." ~ EnKrypt
"Normally that's a bit of a bad thing because RAM is designed to be really fast and hard drives operate at a fraction of that speed." ~ EnKrypt
"well its just in case it gets full" ~ anum
"But see, the beauty here is that DO uses SSDs in their servers, so it's still several times faster than a normal SSD and you'll probably never notice much difference." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, but that can happen quickly. I run a minecraft server on mine which would be impossible otherwise." ~ EnKrypt
"Installing apache" ~ EnKrypt
"You should point your domain to your droplet's IP btw" ~ EnKrypt
"If you haven't already done that" ~ EnKrypt
"you mean nameservers?" ~ anum
"A record to IP" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm used to ns1.hosting.com, ns2.hosting.com" ~ anum
"Who'd your domain registrar?" ~ EnKrypt
"You probably need to change it there" ~ EnKrypt
"yes right now I got ns1.dreamhost.com and ns2" ~ anum
"Oh, ok then change it to these" ~ EnKrypt
"ns1.digitalocean.com" ~ EnKrypt
"ns2.digitalocean.com" ~ EnKrypt
"ns3.digitalocean.com" ~ EnKrypt
"takes up to 24/48 hours to propagate" ~ anum
"Depends actually." ~ EnKrypt
"On Godaddy it takes anywhere between 5 to 15 minutes" ~ EnKrypt
"What you did is point your domain to use DO's nameservers" ~ EnKrypt
"So you need to go to your droplet's DNS settings and set up some values there" ~ EnKrypt
"A record to IP" ~ EnKrypt
"CNAME www to @" ~ EnKrypt
"going there" ~ anum
"where are dns settings in DO" ~ anum
"what name and what IP for the A record I need to add?" ~ anum
"Droplet's IP" ~ EnKrypt
"Are you sure you need a name?" ~ EnKrypt
"right now there's 4 records" ~ anum
"A @ 138.197.137.139" ~ anum
"and the 3 nameservers" ~ anum
"Ah ok so A is done" ~ EnKrypt
"Make a new CNAME record now" ~ EnKrypt
"With what I sais above" ~ EnKrypt
"what as name and what as hostname?" ~ anum
"Uhh, idk why they've phrased it like that" ~ EnKrypt
"name should be www" ~ EnKrypt
"Select record type: CNAME" ~ anum
"And the other value should be @" ~ EnKrypt
"it automaticly changed @ for externet.website." ~ anum
"is that ok?" ~ anum
"so here's my zone file" ~ anum
"www.externet.website. 1800 IN CNAME externet.website." ~ anum
"externet.website. 1800 IN A 138.197.137.139" ~ anum
"and the 3 nameservers" ~ anum
"Yeah I think that looks good" ~ EnKrypt
"what's left to do now :)" ~ anum
"Lol I got confused because I couldn't find mysql" ~ EnKrypt
"Then realized I didn't install it" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, mysql root password" ~ EnKrypt
"Same as your user's password?" ~ EnKrypt
"take that pw for everything" ~ anum
"how much time left (sorry to ask, I'm at work so I gotta plan a bit my time)" ~ anum
"A decent bit. I'll probably finish installing important packages. Might take a few more minutes and head to bed myself." ~ EnKrypt
"And continue tomorrow maybe." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm away the whole weekend, starting in 1hour lol" ~ anum
"camping trip" ~ anum
"Damn. Well maybe when you come back then" ~ EnKrypt
"Or I have ssh access anyway. I'll see if I can finish setting it up while you're away" ~ EnKrypt
"Are you always here?" ~ anum
"Most of the time." ~ EnKrypt
"In this channel?" ~ anum
"Ok I'm done for now" ~ EnKrypt
"Your server is all good" ~ EnKrypt
"When your DNS refreshes, you should see the apache landing page when you visit your site" ~ EnKrypt
"so what's left is... u413?" ~ anum
"yep: http://138.197.137.139/" ~ anum
"Yeah need to set that repo up" ~ EnKrypt
"two things left actually :p" ~ anum
"setting u413 up and explaining me a few things" ~ anum
"But that part's easy" ~ EnKrypt
"Man you're so nice" ~ anum
"Thank you so much" ~ anum
"Haha no problem." ~ EnKrypt
"we'll talk again either sunday evening or monday during the day" ~ anum
"Ok I'm off." ~ EnKrypt
"have a good night" ~ anum
"ah, accidental highlights\" ~ k
"so are you guys helping him" ~ jamezq
"looks like it" ~ jamezq
"u413 never truley dies" ~ jamezq
"it just gets rewritten and rehosted" ~ jamezq
"EnKrypt I really am hopeless" ~ ConsciousCode
"What happened?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yesterday I came home and spent all night making a program that parses a file of hex digits and spits out a .wav file based on the notes described by it" ~ ConsciousCode
"And now today I'm writing a continued fraction library in JS out of boredom" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I should be working on Amos ;_;" ~ ConsciousCode
"Don't tell me you've lost interest in Amos." ~ EnKrypt
"No, definitely not" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess the task ahead is just daunting" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need a crew :I" ~ ConsciousCode
"My schedule is really wonky, but I'm always on board." ~ EnKrypt
"(I'm guessing you and waffles didn't write anything because I explained what I needed like shit)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually, that's because I haven't had the time." ~ EnKrypt
"Otherwise I'd perster you for details till I knew what to do." ~ EnKrypt
"Yesterday I had a talk with my second cousin, who's apparently a "designer" for a company called Continuum" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're hired by other companies to think up what the industry will look like in x years" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then tell them what they need to get there" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sounds like most consulting firms." ~ EnKrypt
"He thought maybe I should try kickstarter, since then I could actually hire programmers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since he reminded me that likely all of my previous failures were from personal burnout" ~ ConsciousCode
"That could be misleading. Doesn't kickstarter say that you eventually get the product/payment at the end?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's implied but you have no legal responsibility to do so" ~ ConsciousCode
"And you get paid after your campaign ends" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I think it works like a bank account so you withdraw as needed...?" ~ ConsciousCode
"IF I remember right, if you reach your kickstater goal, only then are all the pledges collected." ~ EnKrypt
"But again, you can't call it "hiring" if you're not going to pay them" ~ EnKrypt
"If I make money from this, I can hire programmers using that money" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like go on freelancer and post a want ad" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sure but how will that happen? Do you have a revenue model for Amos?" ~ EnKrypt
"I think you're missing something here" ~ ConsciousCode
"Amos has no revenue model intrinsically; making it is a public good" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh you mean make money from your job" ~ EnKrypt
"But kickstarter DOES provide money" ~ ConsciousCode
"So say I get $100k (pushing it, but whatever)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can then collect those kickstarter funds and use those to hire someone from freelancer" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't need to keep them hired indefinitely" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just as long as is needed to get Amos working" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh. I thought you were going to use kickstarter itself to find programmers to hire." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, that sounds legit." ~ EnKrypt
"Well that could work too" ~ ConsciousCode
"It acts as its own want ad" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol advertisements is not our thing tho." ~ EnKrypt
"Do you know someone who's into merketting/media?" ~ EnKrypt
"I could ask /biz/?" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could make a couple minutes video" ~ EnKrypt
"Hmm. I don't think this is something that can be done unless you personally know someone/actually pay someone to do it" ~ EnKrypt
"I could ask my second cousin I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"He seemed interested enough to tell me to "keep in contact"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, since he's a designer." ~ EnKrypt
"But he seemed more interested in my new job" ~ ConsciousCode
"So idk how much he cares or thinks this'll work out" ~ ConsciousCode
"He could at least tell you where to go." ~ EnKrypt
"In my experience, no matter how excellent an idea is, you need to make it presentable and sellable." ~ EnKrypt
"And that might include fancy shallow gimmicks" ~ EnKrypt
"Lol my grandad helped with that" ~ ConsciousCode
"He's kind of a businessman at heart; his main hobby is tinkering with an excel spreadsheet which makes the *perfect* budget" ~ ConsciousCode
"And also charging everything to his credit card and paying it all back at the end of the month, so he has a perfect credit score and gets free stuff from the bank" ~ ConsciousCode
"He perked up when I mentioned that you could make money with your spare computing/memory" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I had to explain to him that it's impossible to say how much a lambda is worth because of how macroeconomics works" ~ ConsciousCode
"Mark (2nd cousin) said my intro paragraph of the whitepaper was a good intro, and it talks about that primarily" ~ ConsciousCode
""You have wasted computation and memory and that's valuable if only there was a system to use it"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you think Amos is too important to lose interest in?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hmm yeah that's one big point for sure. You can prolly extract a few more by targetting people with different interests. It'll require research though. Like I said it's its own field and I don't think we can do it ourselves." ~ EnKrypt
"It's hard to quantify the importance of something that's still doesn't exist." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm asking about your opinion" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since you seemed a little more perturbed than usual when you thought I was giving up" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think if it's out there, it could have a serious effect on things." ~ EnKrypt
"So yeah I'm motivated and don't want you to give up on it." ~ EnKrypt
"Since that is what you tend to do." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, though like I said I think I've realized what's wrong" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean I realized it a long time ago but now it's really hit me" ~ ConsciousCode
"I try to do this stuff all on my own and the sheer weight of it all burns me out before I even begin" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hmm. I actually think it's something else. May I propose an alternate explanation?" ~ EnKrypt
"I think what you like to do is thinking through things. Creating a system from scratch, running it in your head and removing pitfalls and obstacles until it's perfect." ~ EnKrypt
"Once that's done, there's no thinking left, just bringing that idea to life." ~ EnKrypt
"So I'm a designer, not an implementer" ~ ConsciousCode
"And that's just labour and doesn't interest you." ~ EnKrypt
"Idk if that's the right term." ~ EnKrypt
"Systems architect maybe?" ~ EnKrypt
"Makes sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I'm thinking I should post to /biz/ and ask for advice on this" ~ ConsciousCode
"http://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/1442880" ~ ConsciousCode
"The fact that this is right next to yours is... sad" ~ EnKrypt
"https://boards.4chan.org/biz/thread/1442874/shsg-selling-human-shit-general" ~ EnKrypt
"1 reply and it's crap." ~ EnKrypt
"Is /biz/ a fast moving board?" ~ EnKrypt
"How many programmers do you think I need?" ~ ConsciousCode
"1 for networking, 1 for ontology, and... 1 for integration?" ~ ConsciousCode
"So 2-3 I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"I keep licking my mustache for some reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think you'd be able to delegate like that." ~ EnKrypt
"You might get anything from on ok coder to someone into a niche field." ~ EnKrypt
"So you'll have to adjust roles accordingly." ~ EnKrypt
"My internet's been shut off all day for no apparent reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"you pinged out 9h ago" ~ k
"http://externet.website/u413/" ~ anum
"well, I've only seen its decline, but yeah" ~ k
"oh no, I hope it didn't sound as if I wanted to dismiss them or anything :/" ~ k
"We were really horrible at coding when we wrote u413." ~ EnKrypt
"We did not future proof the repo at all lmao." ~ EnKrypt
"I fixed a few bugs in there btw." ~ EnKrypt
"Lol, I figured" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's why I warned him against using it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also, do you know who owns the u413.com domain?" ~ EnKrypt
"Because it's currently unused." ~ EnKrypt
"Did you see anum's version tho" ~ EnKrypt
"There's nothing on it atm" ~ EnKrypt
"The guy who was here" ~ EnKrypt
"So it works?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It took a bit of effort tho" ~ EnKrypt
"externet.website/u413" ~ EnKrypt
"But with the fixes to the repo, it should work out of the box from now." ~ EnKrypt
"Although I doubt someone ever will again." ~ EnKrypt
"omg, externet.website" ~ k
">"Right click, copy and paste are disabled on the login page."" ~ k
"this is the stupidest thing there could be" ~ k
"I'm not totally sure how you'd even accomplish that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Eat the right click event?" ~ ConsciousCode
"not right click, just copy/paste" ~ k
"oh, also cut" ~ k
"   $('body').bind('cut copy paste', function (e) {" ~ k
"        e.preventDefault();" ~ k
"they did it this way" ~ k
"He literally..." ~ ConsciousCode
"anyway, regardless how it's implemented or how easy to circumvent, this is plain stupid thing to do" ~ k
"Shitpost about it" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's the only way" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think it's fully functional" ~ k
"and if it is, I don't have a password" ~ k
"fwiw, such code doesn't prevent copying through primary selection as it's fully passive and doesn't generate any copy events; sadly pasting from primary with middle click still generates paste event" ~ k
"k, do you think it makes sense to use REST and websockets in the same web app?" ~ EnKrypt_
"why not, these are totally different things" ~ k
"But I can also do the entire thing using websockets. I wanted to maintain efficiency by using http REST for things that will be used less occasionally and sockets for things that need to served bidirectionally and live." ~ EnKrypt_
"Imagine a chat app. I thought of using REST to fetch contacts list, and messages for that contact." ~ EnKrypt_
"And websockets for sending a message, and receiving a message in real time." ~ EnKrypt_
"But I don't know if that combination makes sense." ~ EnKrypt_
"I think it does, REST is THE right thing to do on the Web, it's much easier to reuse and automatically means you have clean API when you do it; it's just that not everything can be (conveniently) made REST-ful (like, real-time messaging in your chat app)" ~ k
"so yes, I think it does" ~ k
"Not much. Are/were you a regular at U413?" ~ EnKrypt

"yes, Super Smash Bros Melee For the Nintendo Gamecube" ~ jamezq
"I am active in my local competative scene" ~ jamezq
"Do you trip often?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or is that Brawl" ~ ConsciousCode
"There is no tripping in melee" ~ jamezq
"that is brawl" ~ jamezq
"brawl is no longer played, it died" ~ jamezq
"pretty much it is just Melee and Smash 4" ~ jamezq
"they are both growing and about equal size in the competative world" ~ jamezq
"all other smashes died" ~ jamezq
"pretty much" ~ jamezq
"Uhh, silly question, but how am I supposed to cook sausages apart from frying them?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm not sure if I can boil them." ~ EnKrypt
"You can boil them" ~ ConsciousCode
"you can boil " ~ jamezq
"They float when they're cooked" ~ ConsciousCode
"But won't it take away the flavor?" ~ EnKrypt
"anyway, I have a car now" ~ jamezq
"but you are too far away to visit PI" ~ jamezq
"Dibs on shotgun." ~ EnKrypt

"are you still in india" ~ jamezq
"Lol same place." ~ EnKrypt
"that is even farther" ~ jamezq

"Still, dibs on shotgun. For whenever in the future." ~ EnKrypt
"maybe zomie apocalypse, you can the shotgun" ~ jamezq
"or WW3, but most likely a wedding" ~ jamezq
"JQ I had an idea while driving" ~ ConsciousCode
"please dispense this idea upon me sempai" ~ jamezq
"I've been thinking because of Amos lately that information is intrinsically worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hence why piracy exists" ~ ConsciousCode
"The internet is the ultimate copy machine" ~ ConsciousCode
"Anything that touches it is there forever, a million-fold" ~ ConsciousCode
"people copy stuff because it's not worth anything?" ~ jamezq
"Yes, hear me out" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's "worthless" because it has no scarcity" ~ ConsciousCode
"Air isn't worth anything, but people breathe it anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"I was then thinking about how companies respond to piracy" ~ ConsciousCode
"And usually they complain that it's "theft" etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then I wondered, is it actually a "free market" if they're going to the government for enforcement of arbitrary rules?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is it "acceptable" for business models to be based on either irrationality or calls to a higher power?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically, if someone can steal, why shouldn't they?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It should be up to the individual business to build their model around that possibility" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or add prevention mechanisms" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which can be selected by the free market" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because I now see companies selling information as peddling air" ~ ConsciousCode
"Something with 0 scarcity and thus no value, all the while complaining that people are taking lungfuls" ~ ConsciousCode
"What they're REALLY providing is the service of CREATING that data" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not distributing it" ~ ConsciousCode
"that is pretty much true yes" ~ jamezq
"So it's like a company converting CO2 to O2" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then charging people for taking breaths" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's ass-backwards and can't be enforced" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well if a company actually did spend money producing it that might make more sense" ~ jamezq
"like it takes money to produce movies" ~ jamezq
"but as of right now, no one really spends money producing air" ~ jamezq
"Yes, like I said that's the CREATION of the data that they're providing" ~ ConsciousCode
"they do with water, and it cost money" ~ jamezq
"And I think the internet offers a way to commoditize that directly" ~ ConsciousCode
"or more so cleaning and transporting" ~ jamezq
"Water isn't freely available the way air is" ~ ConsciousCode
"They really are offering the service of distribution" ~ ConsciousCode
"well go on, " ~ jamezq
"Take Kickstarter" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think that's essentially Creation as a Commodity" ~ ConsciousCode
"you are right our current system is not a free market" ~ jamezq
"and it's not capitalism eitehr" ~ jamezq
"A company could make its business selling their ideas to the public" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then making those ideas a reality once they get enough money" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or you could "subscribe" to the creation of products as with Patreon" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which could give you access to limited stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is also worthless, but has the extra service of immediacy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is there a disconnect in understanding here?" ~ ConsciousCode
"well, there is the issue in if we give the company money first, the creator assumes little risk, besides that of future buissness." ~ jamezq
"That's presumably the risk" ~ ConsciousCode
"Most movies fail, and there is value in us only spending money on what we know before hand we will probably like" ~ jamezq
"Continued money-getting" ~ ConsciousCode
"rather than spending it on a project only to have it never come out, etc" ~ jamezq
"Maybe there could be a business just for absorbing consumer-end risk" ~ ConsciousCode
"Investing in worthwhile projects" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you're right, there isn't incentive to finish" ~ ConsciousCode
"The incentive optimizes towards continued development forever" ~ ConsciousCode
"But there basically has to be a way for this to work" ~ ConsciousCode
"well I think having the option of using patreon, as we do now works fine" ~ jamezq
"Otherwise those businesses just can't exist" ~ ConsciousCode
"no reason to take away the other option" ~ jamezq
"They can on the internet now because it isn't decentralized" ~ ConsciousCode
"plenty of people do you pateron" ~ jamezq
"But the moment Amos goes live, information is 100% worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
"I myself support some people" ~ jamezq
"well idk, I generally buy stuff if I like it after pirating it" ~ jamezq
"this is pretty common" ~ jamezq
"a general sense of morality many people have" ~ jamezq
"gives things value" ~ jamezq
"Yes but that's going outside of their planned business model" ~ ConsciousCode
"because they don't feel like using it without giving something back if they like it" ~ jamezq
"And relies on irrationality" ~ ConsciousCode
"sure, humans being irrational in a free market is super interesting." ~ jamezq
"I'd much prefer things be based on rationality" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean, in a sense it is" ~ jamezq
"So you already know the worst case and irrationality only makes things better" ~ ConsciousCode
"if you can predict irrational behavior" ~ jamezq
"and you can" ~ jamezq
"you can choose what you want to do based on it" ~ jamezq
"Rational in the sense that a robot with no human emotions would follow the same behaviors" ~ ConsciousCode
"Resources = good, 0 consideration of others except in how they interact with you in response" ~ ConsciousCode
"some people might think that their product is better suited to a continual money suppy will constant releases" ~ jamezq
"others might want investers to help and relase it all at once" ~ jamezq
"there is not really 1 right choice" ~ jamezq
"Video games aren't the only thing either" ~ ConsciousCode
"How would a TV show exist on the post-public internet?" ~ ConsciousCode
"They upload the newest episode and suddenly everyone can access it" ~ ConsciousCode
"In fact, they even have to be alerted to the fact that it was uploaded to begin with" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because the consensus is what determines legitimacy" ~ ConsciousCode
"well why can't people do things like make it harder to copy" ~ jamezq
"Because that's literally impossible?" ~ ConsciousCode
"To view something, your computer must have the data to display it" ~ ConsciousCode
"So even if you make the most convoluted encryption imaginable" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's always possible for someone to set the window to go to their video driver and record it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right but its much easier to download a file than to have to copy the specific window and pipe all the audio intto a file" ~ jamezq
"making sure you never pause" ~ jamezq
"that is harder" ~ jamezq
"Think about it like this JQ" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can download a movie in like 5 min" ~ jamezq
"Amos is the bittorrent-internet" ~ ConsciousCode
"but your way, I have to watch the whole thing" ~ jamezq
"Pirating is not a pleasant business" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then put it out, sure" ~ jamezq
"You have to go to shady sites with loads of ads and half don't even work or have viruses" ~ ConsciousCode
"and again people if they have a cheap and easy way to access it, tend to use those methods" ~ jamezq
"Amos makes that process as convenient as viewing an .html file" ~ ConsciousCode
"You have a friend with a copy of the latest Adventure Time" ~ ConsciousCode
"He says "hey yo it's here!" and gives you a link" ~ ConsciousCode
"And there's nothing that can be done to stop the transfer, even if everyone but him refused to send it" ~ ConsciousCode
"that is fine" ~ jamezq
"So how does Adventure Time make money?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It can't be done at distribution" ~ ConsciousCode
"people buy it " ~ jamezq
"watch it on a subscription service" ~ jamezq
"or buy swag" ~ jamezq
"I buy software all the time that I can steal, as I have said" ~ jamezq
"Swag can be bought sure, but not everything translates to merchandise well" ~ ConsciousCode
"that is true" ~ jamezq
"Yes but JQ, that's irrational" ~ ConsciousCode
"And partially because it's inconvenient to pirate" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, not really, it never takes me longer than a few min to find and download something" ~ jamezq
"Anyway, as long as people stay irrational. And there is no reason to think they won't, it will still work" ~ jamezq
"And it takes less time to find the official site and buy it" ~ ConsciousCode
"otherwise yea they would have to move to a different system" ~ jamezq
"Nigga we're on the precipice of the singularity" ~ ConsciousCode
"No it doesn't" ~ jamezq
"it takes me less time in most cases to pirate it than to buy it" ~ jamezq
"I've found that it generally does, at least if something's online" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have to go through purchasing auth, etc" ~ jamezq
"Because then it's the first result in Google, you don't have to check its legitimacy, etdc" ~ ConsciousCode
"yea that is an issue with most people, not really with me or probably you either." ~ jamezq
"Purchasing auth is abstracted these days, and Amos makes that effortless too" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm designing a system, JQ" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have to base predictions off of the hypothetical rational masses" ~ ConsciousCode
"Anyway, even if it was effortless I'm saying I would still purchase it. " ~ jamezq
"Plan for individual self-optimization" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sure, go ahead" ~ jamezq
"lets assume humans will do anything they can short of hurting others" ~ jamezq
"I guess what's most frustrating here is you're missing the point" ~ ConsciousCode
"or actually taking physical property" ~ jamezq
"Yes it would probably work that way in practice" ~ ConsciousCode
"so go ahead" ~ jamezq
"But I'm asking how that would be solved in the economics world" ~ ConsciousCode
"If such a system makes modern media impossible given rational agents" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't care about practicalities because frankly I'm not those companies and I'm going to release this the moment I have it" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's more of a puzzle than anything else, and you're saying "well you can just take the stickers off and put it back in the right colors"" ~ ConsciousCode
"anyway if that system you can do a few things" ~ jamezq
"one, don't sell data, sell access, maybe on locked down devices. Probably would be hacked quickly" ~ jamezq
"Access is worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
"Data and access here are equivalent" ~ ConsciousCode
"two, like you said, get people to pay before the product is released." ~ jamezq
"three, release, make 0 money (why would you since people won't pay)" ~ jamezq
"but then say for the next episode you need x goal" ~ jamezq
"That's roughly the same as pay before release" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it would work" ~ ConsciousCode
"pretty much the same" ~ jamezq
"It's also important to note that in Amos, money comes out of nothing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or practically nothing, anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"a subscription service is also basically pay before release but a lot of other media produces are in on the same system." ~ jamezq
"Lambdas can be generated at a rate of what'll probably be like 50/sec" ~ ConsciousCode
"just like real life" ~ jamezq
"or really, money comes out of debt, nowadays" ~ jamezq
"And new lambdas appear when you generously donate the rewards of your computation to the process which required it" ~ ConsciousCode
"lambdas are the currency" ~ jamezq
"oh another way" ~ jamezq
"things like trust networks" ~ jamezq
"you join a place, maybe get a key" ~ jamezq
"that allows you to purchase the media" ~ jamezq
"you can a group of people, in that network" ~ jamezq
"I think you've missed the idea of what Amos actually is" ~ ConsciousCode
"You keep suggesting access lockdown, which is impossible" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, literally impossible" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unless you put your stuff on a server" ~ ConsciousCode
"In which case you're not actually using Amos" ~ ConsciousCode
"no it's not" ~ jamezq
"I didn't finish" ~ jamezq
"you get a key that allows you to purchase" ~ jamezq
"and you get a slightly different version, an invisible audio or visual signature" ~ jamezq
"and if you or a group member leaks it, that groups access is revoked, so that way there is an incentive not to give it away" ~ jamezq
"even though you could with 0 effort, it restricts future access" ~ jamezq
"kinda like a vip membership, if you leak stuff, we revoke it." ~ jamezq
"anyway, but continue with lambdas" ~ jamezq
"Yeah, you've missed the point" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also clients are pseudo-anonymous in this scheme anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"It'd be like banning 4chan users" ~ ConsciousCode
"They just come back with a proxy" ~ ConsciousCode
"you are not banning the users" ~ jamezq
"you are revoking the key access, they can't just use it again" ~ jamezq
"they have to get another one from you" ~ jamezq
"since you generate them" ~ jamezq
"they are still anonymous in my scheme too" ~ jamezq
"Why should they care about key access when someone somewhere will have at least one key?" ~ ConsciousCode
"One person shares, everyone has it" ~ ConsciousCode
"right, but they that group doesn't get the next thing" ~ jamezq
"because their access got revoked" ~ jamezq
"they don't release to that key anymore" ~ jamezq
"so there is a rational incentive not to share it" ~ jamezq
"since they can track down what group released it" ~ jamezq
"Or a bunch of users group together, buy each key, and distribute" ~ ConsciousCode
"Each person only pays a fraction of a cent" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nothing of value is lost" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everyone has the thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"sure, they can try to do that, but they can just revoke each time and make more money off keys" ~ jamezq
"nothing of value is lost" ~ jamezq
"they can wait until a key have x members to give it stuff" ~ jamezq
"there are lots of ways it can be done pretty easily" ~ jamezq
"Except that's 1 key per thing released" ~ ConsciousCode
"it's not like private sites can't exist on the internet" ~ jamezq
"even in a bit-torrent internet" ~ jamezq
"Yes, like I said you can connect servers easily" ~ ConsciousCode
"no there is no encrpyion on this internet?" ~ jamezq
"Unlike some OTHER distributed computing platforms (cough ethereum cough)" ~ ConsciousCode
"so there is*?" ~ jamezq
"Not intrinsically" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can encrypt your data and have computers pass that around" ~ ConsciousCode
"They can't do anything with it if only you have the key to unlocking it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yea you can then make a private website using simple encrpytion methods" ~ jamezq
"just like any private website that exists " ~ jamezq
"only serve data to people who can produce x" ~ jamezq
"Once someone "malicious" unlocks it, it can be distributed to everyone though" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean the interent now doesn't intrinsically have private sites either" ~ jamezq
"I mean that is the case now, private trackets manage to exist" ~ jamezq
"if one person distributes there account they can see it's usuage become abnormal" ~ jamezq
"Well sure, that's easy" ~ ConsciousCode
"and block it" ~ jamezq
"really easy" ~ jamezq
"They're just isolated p2p networks" ~ ConsciousCode
"But Amos isn't "supposed" to work that way" ~ ConsciousCode
"sure, but if it can, then technically buissnesses can do that to" ~ jamezq
"And you need special monitoring software to check it" ~ ConsciousCode
"even if amos isn't supposed to do that" ~ jamezq
"There isn't anything on Amos that tells you that information has leaked" ~ ConsciousCode
"You have to find that yourself" ~ ConsciousCode
"And someone could change a single bit of the leaked info and it'd have a totally new address" ~ ConsciousCode
"Meaning you'd have to perform a full data analysis to see who leakedi t" ~ ConsciousCode
"And do that on all data everywhere, actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since there's nothing necessarily connecting a hard memory block to your private network" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though there is something you can "sell" people which is "restricted"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is immediacy" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you're one of the first people to get access to your show, that's valuable" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whereas the rest of the internet has to wait a while for the information to spread" ~ ConsciousCode
"so describe the money more" ~ jamezq
"it sounds intereesting" ~ jamezq
"Basically 1 lambda = 1 computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's the reverse of bitcoin, which is infinitely divisible" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lambdas are atomic integers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since you can't have half a computation (or well you could, but that's less convenient)" ~ ConsciousCode
"This has interesting economic properties" ~ ConsciousCode
"For one, it won't be subject to pump and dump like other coins" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's also more stable intrinsically, since it's based on an intrinsically valuable resource" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's kind of like going back to the gold standard, but without banks to ruin it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whereas bitcoins have no value, you can't exchange a bitcoin for anything unless other people think it's valuable" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it fluctuates much more rapidly" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wanna install a new window manager named dwm" ~ ConsciousCode
"I git cloned it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where should I put it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"How goes progress on Amos?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm currently at 0%" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well, that is where you start from." ~ EnKrypt
"If you'd like some help, I can sit down with you on the 1st and chalk things down." ~ EnKrypt
"I already have stuff "chalked down", it's a matter of actually doing them .-." ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is complicated further by this new job" ~ ConsciousCode
"It leaves me only about 4 hours of free time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you have specs for developers chalked down?" ~ EnKrypt
"Because that's what you'd need if you want devs to contribute" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess not, it's too in my head" ~ ConsciousCode
"But no one really wants to help" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just like always" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well I think I can get you some people." ~ EnKrypt
"But it will take time." ~ EnKrypt
"I have an eternity so I guess I can wait" ~ ConsciousCode
"And there's always me. Although it's hard to say when I can help." ~ EnKrypt
"I think this will be a great way for me to learn p2p stuff along the way" ~ EnKrypt
"k: http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=27790" ~ ConsciousCode

"k I want to install a new Window Manager to replace Cinnamon but I can't figure out how to transition" ~ ConsciousCode
"I already have the executable here but it can't replace it itself" ~ ConsciousCode
"u on mint, right?" ~ k
"I always depised gdm and such so... I can only tell you to rtfm" ~ k
"(and be prepared for a lot of fuckery going on there)" ~ k
"I'm gonna try dwm" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's < 2000 lines of code and you're supposed to change its source and recompile" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it doesn't have a replace option" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I have to somehow get Cinnamon to shut down without restarting and start up dwm in the process" ~ ConsciousCode
"Didn't know what rtfm meant" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I tried dwm for a few days many years ago" ~ k
""Read the fucking manual"" ~ ConsciousCode
"how could you not know THAT" ~ k
"Idk, never saw it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've already googled around, this problem is specific to this case" ~ ConsciousCode
"killing your wm will end your session, this is how things normally are, some wms might have some way of telling them to exec themselves into something else but most won't" ~ k
"I tried killing Cinnamon" ~ ConsciousCode
"It just restarted after a bit" ~ ConsciousCode
"you have to tell your login manager how to start your session with a new one" ~ k
"normally if that's packaged for your system, it should appear of new kind of "session" that you can select when you log in" ~ k
"/etc/X11/default-display-manager according to SO" ~ ConsciousCode
"Aw shoot, that's the login manager thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok let's try that" ~ ConsciousCode
"hm, it's mdm not gdm" ~ k
"I think I configured it right" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok I'm confused now" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's still using Cinnamon" ~ ConsciousCode
"I set dwm to the default manager" ~ ConsciousCode
"There was a lot more lag than I remember on bootup though" ~ ConsciousCode
"So maybe it's trying dwm and spitting out an error?" ~ ConsciousCode
"it's more than likely that you got something wrong, there's a lot of moving parts and I can't guess what could go wrong bc there's literally hundreds of things that could" ~ k
"but if you're lucky maybe ~/.xsesion-errors (or something like that, not sure if 'twas - or _) could have some hints" ~ k
"Has Linux grown too complicated?" ~ ConsciousCode
"this is confusing, man 8 mdm gives overview of files used and ends with "only the /etc/mdm/Sessions one is required to exist." but it doesn't exist on my mint vm and yet it clearly works; wtf, someone forgot to put something important in the manual AGAIN, didn't they" ~ k
"this has nothing to do with linux" ~ k
"not even with GNU" ~ k
"(GNU is Unix-Haters secret plan to destroy Unix, so far quite successful)" ~ k
"also you can sidestep a lot of this complexity" ~ k
"for example I don't use any login manager, I log in on the console and use startx(1) to star my session up, and I don't even use .xsession but instead I directly use .xinitrc" ~ k
"Why not make a script or something to do that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since you're running it every time you login" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess you don't login much since >linux" ~ ConsciousCode
"bc I don't run it every time" ~ k
"Ok new plan: I make my own GNU with black jack and hookers to go on top of the Linux kernel B)" ~ ConsciousCode

"I really just want Unix back" ~ k
"The ponies get younger every time I go on" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe /mlp/ is now cheese pizza" ~ ConsciousCode
"dangerously cute" ~ k
"How does Unix differ from Linux?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or vice versa technically" ~ ConsciousCode
"how the hell should I answer that" ~ k
"I don't know enough to know why you can't answer it" ~ ConsciousCode
"look, on Unix you take the tool you want to use, read its manual which is 2 pages long top for super complex ones, and you know everything you need to use it and compose it with others" ~ k
"on GNU, you read the manual and it says that sorry all the documentation is not in info files; fine, you launch info browser and you navigate complex tree of pointless chapters each explaining shitlowad of tangentially related things you either already know or don't need to know at all" ~ k
"And so it's heralded as a triumph of development but lacks half of what would be good for dev" ~ ConsciousCode
"and in the end once you get don to the bussines, the tool in question has more options than all the unix tools taken togeter and it also brews your coffe" ~ k
"When I was waiting for 2 hours at the DMV, I thought up a weird idea for a file system" ~ ConsciousCode
"(when moon is full, otherwise it's tea)" ~ k
"Basically, all installed programs have their own micro-filesystem and they decide what to do with it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Program interfacing is done via ports, as if each program is a separate computer on the internet or something" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you want to load a file into program X, you have X ask Y for the file and Y pipes it over or gives an error" ~ ConsciousCode

"Those are new?" ~ ConsciousCode

"Idk though, I think Plan 9's is better" ~ ConsciousCode
"Research Unix Version 8" ~ k
"Process-oriented filesystems like what I was suggesting abstract away user permissions" ~ ConsciousCode
"So Plan9 needs a hard-coded permission structure of some kind" ~ ConsciousCode
"(which executable can handle which fs etc)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Whereas if all filesystems are addressed by their handler directly, each one can manage its own permissions" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that comes at the cost of filesystem unity" ~ ConsciousCode
"Plan9 looks vaguely Unix-like" ~ ConsciousCode
"It also means that programs must be installed" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since they have to always exist as objects" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't follow, what's the difference?" ~ k
"With Plan 9, programs request filesystem access from the OS and can be arbitrary executables" ~ ConsciousCode
"With my thing, you have to install executables so the OS knows about them and can route requests to them" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can't run arbitrary code (at least without some kind of code-running exec)" ~ ConsciousCode
"also that Plan 9 looks Unix-like is no coincidence because it was made by the same people who worked on Unix and it actually delivered on the promises Unix made ("everything is a file" which arguably isn't really true in any other system than plan 9, damn those ioctl(2)s)" ~ k
"Man now I want to use this OS" ~ ConsciousCode
"I could be the ultimate OS hipster" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it'll have like 0 support" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ubuntu's nice because most things work on it without fuss" ~ ConsciousCode
"btw, I recently met on #/pone/ (on Rizon) someone who uses rc as their login shell" ~ k
"Well, lots of fuss, but it runs while throwing a tantrum" ~ ConsciousCode
"that's the shell from plan 9" ~ k
"Were they using P9?" ~ ConsciousCode
"(I use es which had syntax inspired from rc but not as a login shell)" ~ k
"Oh they just ported it to Linux" ~ ConsciousCode
"wait a minute" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could make an Ubuntu VM in Plan 9 and put it in a special fs" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then you could run P9 while still having full compatibility" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is this my destiny? :O" ~ ConsciousCode

"once in a while I tell people they should learn ed(1) because that's THE standard editor that is available everywhere and will never fail you, and I always bring out that when I tried out Plan 9 they had that super awesome new editor that requires as much learning as vi to use efficiently (except it's not vi so I didn't know it) and quess what, I just used ed then to write few simple programs to try things out etc" ~ k
"I should have a CD with some version of plan 9 stashed somewhere" ~ k

"Ah shit, they're compatibility libraries" ~ ConsciousCode
"archive doesn't always have everything because their crawls are sometimes superficial, but if it's discoverable (like plain link to a file) then with some luck you might get the thing" ~ k
"also, there's Inferno which is a derivate of Plan 9 that is actively maintained I think" ~ k
"(I never tried it, though)" ~ k

"Inferno is exactly what I want in an OS" ~ ConsciousCode
"Plan9 + compiles everything to its own exe type" ~ ConsciousCode

"Or apt-cache search" ~ EnKrypt
"Idk something like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"This fancy supermarket opened literally next door." ~ EnKrypt
"And I found tabasco and sriracha." ~ EnKrypt
"But why the fuck are they so expensive." ~ EnKrypt
"Probably because they're imported" ~ ConsciousCode
"Muh import tax." ~ EnKrypt
"Sriracha is around $10/bottle here, but it lasts for ages because it's an enormous hot sauce bottle" ~ ConsciousCode

"You should do it now" ~ ConsciousCode

"We have HISTORY to make!" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wanna work on Amos some" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've gotten over getting fired I guessa" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh ouch, how did that happen?" ~ EnKrypt
"Since I wrote 2% of a video game yesterday" ~ ConsciousCode
"I was an insubordinate pissant basically" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I think it's relatively fine because my parents are looking into the next possibility which  might be in-patient therapy" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which I think will help" ~ ConsciousCode
"I was depressed this weekend but now I don't feel so bad so idk" ~ ConsciousCode
"Aren't you on SSRIs?" ~ EnKrypt
"Antidepressants, from my experience, don't eliminate bad feelings" ~ ConsciousCode
"They make it so they hurt less" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like an emotional anaesthetic" ~ ConsciousCode
"But no amount of ibuprofen will make a hole in your chest not painful" ~ ConsciousCode
"Being depressed on SSRIs sounds dangerous." ~ EnKrypt
"(for that you need hard shit like opioids)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think it's "dangerous", it just means I must've been REALLY upset for that much to have gotten out" ~ ConsciousCode
"That sounds dangerous to me." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm still not suicidal and I don't think I will be while on meds" ~ ConsciousCode
"I was suicidal before because of shitty circumstances" ~ ConsciousCode

"circumstances are fickle." ~ EnKrypt
"But now I recognize that that's unlikely given I have middle class parents" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I've been there, so I'm not going to be a hypocrite." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok so anyway" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've been poking amos some" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I stopped working on it last time because of yet another trivial detail" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which still needs to be resolved actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also, I realized that amos can't be done in-browser (with current web tech) because of p2p stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"There could be extensions or plugins later, but for now my focus is on node.js local servers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right, Amos. I've been putting off asking you for specs (I also saw your mention day before) because I've been working on something else. But it is actually almost done. So like give me 5 minutes." ~ EnKrypt
"Web workers can't help?" ~ EnKrypt
"What are you working on?" ~ ConsciousCode
"And no, web workers only speed things up" ~ ConsciousCode
"https://github.com/EnKrypt/Botato" ~ EnKrypt
"The problem is web tech is very protective about remote access stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"Love the name" ~ ConsciousCode
"They don't generally want you making arbitrary IP packets" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it's contained to HTTP supersets on blessed ports" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also cross domain security stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'd imagine botnets are illegal, right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"CORS can be enabled on backend." ~ EnKrypt
"botnet is associated with illegality." ~ EnKrypt
"It is just "bot network"" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh so this is something to link all your computers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, that would be one application." ~ EnKrypt
"(which is actually what amos does, just with untrusted computers)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Link them all up to one network and have them all perform common tasks" ~ EnKrypt
"Amos is computation tho, this is just remote management" ~ EnKrypt
"Why not just use team viewer?" ~ ConsciousCode
"To do that with ssh, I think you'll have to manually set up 'network-pipe-to-bash' type functionality." ~ EnKrypt
"So this is a literal botnet but with computers you own" ~ ConsciousCode
"This abstracts the shell out." ~ EnKrypt
"Well technically, that is not a requirement." ~ EnKrypt
"I briefly considered offering my computers but idk" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not that I don't trust you necessarily," ~ ConsciousCode
"It was actually inspired by someone else's idea to sneakily write a personalized RAT" ~ EnKrypt
"But I don't know how safe your protocol is and maybe don't want you in my porn?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess I don't care too much" ~ ConsciousCode
"But yeah highly recommend encrypting communications" ~ ConsciousCode
"I did not even think of that" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, that should be a priority." ~ EnKrypt
"Actually. IRC is over ssl" ~ EnKrypt
"But that depends on how you're connecting." ~ EnKrypt
"Go with an RSA handshake + AES" ~ ConsciousCode
"And not every server supports ssl" ~ EnKrypt
"IRC is not over ssl" ~ ConsciousCode
"This server is not, yeah." ~ EnKrypt
"It's totally unencrypted unless you have an IRC extension of some kind" ~ ConsciousCode
"But most are." ~ EnKrypt
"Nah m8 ircv3 has ssl as a requirement" ~ EnKrypt
"RSA handshake + AES is what ssl uses AFAIK" ~ ConsciousCode
"At least it is so in the spec" ~ EnKrypt
"Though ssl also has trusted public key certificates" ~ ConsciousCode
"I thought IRC was made once in the 70s and then never updated" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol it's dying slowly." ~ EnKrypt
"But people are still working on it afaik" ~ EnKrypt
"That's kinda nice to hear" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I wish they moved away from a text-based protocol" ~ ConsciousCode
"And maybe added more features and guaranteed unicode support" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually, I think unicode support exists." ~ EnKrypt
"I know support exists, but not necessarily a mandate" ~ ConsciousCode
"But when I was setting up UnrealIRCd, I think I had the option to enable it." ~ EnKrypt
"It probably uses an undefined encoding with vaguely ASCII expectations" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since it uses certain characters as controls" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't need to make it right the first time, I've already built in versioning so any bad designs can be abandoned" ~ ConsciousCode
"It just needs to be turing complete" ~ ConsciousCode
"How will you maintain versions tho" ~ EnKrypt
"The protocol has a versioning byte before all packets" ~ ConsciousCode
"That means I can change it however I wish" ~ ConsciousCode
"Say version 0 is no longer supported" ~ ConsciousCode
"All new packets start with 1 and error on >1" ~ ConsciousCode
"Old packets are still read as they're recognized, but are deprecated/thought of as less valuablw" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even if I have more than 256 versions, I can make it so starting with 0xff starts reading a more extensive protocol that has more versions available" ~ ConsciousCode
"Right now my computational model is workers, processes, and threads" ~ ConsciousCode
"Workers are just processes/threads that are controlled by RSA keys" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can affect things by puppeting a process" ~ ConsciousCode
"Processes are bundles of code that maintain state and resource allocations" ~ ConsciousCode
"And threads are generally the threads of computation within a process" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess it's not all that important to distinguish them" ~ ConsciousCode
"So all that's good, but I'm wrestling with how to implement process code" ~ ConsciousCode
"I know there needs to be some kind of "interface"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like code you call externally, using the process' resources but requiring a pay-in, which affects the internal state safely" ~ ConsciousCode
"And there needs to be threads which sustain themselves indefinitely within a process" ~ ConsciousCode
"But how is that encoded in the blockplait?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I keep going back and forth between stack machines, register machines, VMs, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need to find the right combination of features which best work to Amos' weaknesses" ~ ConsciousCode
"Mostly that memory lookup is expensive as fuck and I can't support a stack intrinsically" ~ ConsciousCode
"There also needs to be a form of soft memory caching within the blockplait" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well, not *needs* to be" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that'd make it more robust as process state doesn't depend entirely on the temporary states of participating computers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Btw, do stop me if I say something you don't totally understand" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not just ducking you, I want input" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I already know that code has to be batched, with memory lookups being prerequisites, and those code batches can't be any more than intrinsics, as function calls require a stack" ~ ConsciousCode
"So all code would essentially end with a goto" ~ ConsciousCode
"I understand what you mean by a process, but not to what level of layering you want to have it be in." ~ EnKrypt
"A js process? Assembly? Does it just represent a unit of something that does the computation work?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's an abstract process in the VM" ~ ConsciousCode
"A process is the set of all running threads, associated lambdas (just a number, its "wealth"), interfaces, and "owned" hard memory" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where does a VM come into amos?" ~ EnKrypt
"Amos IS the VM" ~ ConsciousCode
"Think of a process as being like an application on your local computer" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok but how would you ideally have it be represented in Amos? As a class?" ~ EnKrypt
"Processes are intrinsic here" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're... assumed as existent, so thoroughly that there's no way to avoid them?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's like how in Java, everything is a class" ~ ConsciousCode
"Classes are intrinsic, there's no way that they're "represented"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everything is just made that way" ~ ConsciousCode
"So as an application, it has its own RAM allocations, probably some files on your hard drive, resources given to it by the OS, and code that it runs in parallel with other apps" ~ ConsciousCode
"All of these are simulated by the amos network" ~ ConsciousCode
"I had a thought that I could alternatively name it unamos" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which would add extra layers of meaning, but would make it sound more Spanish" ~ ConsciousCode
"Sounds like unanimous" ~ EnKrypt
"Not quite, but it's nicer" ~ EnKrypt
"Than Amos imo" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, unanimous and un amos (one love)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also the amos part" ~ ConsciousCode
"As a kind of "oversoul" in my philosophizing with my mother" ~ ConsciousCode
"Although I see it as being kinda hard to pronounce" ~ ConsciousCode
"Latin-wise it's easy, oo na mos" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah that's how I pronounced it in my head" ~ EnKrypt
"But native English speakers will naturally want to say "yu nae mos"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which sounds... off?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like... not-English" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hard to think about almost" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's alright tho. There's way more popular things with weirder names." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok so that's over and done with" ~ ConsciousCode
"Uh... Do you get processes now?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, I think." ~ EnKrypt
"Why do I feel like I should be doing something right now..." ~ ConsciousCode
"So what I'm looking at is the block-level encoding of threads" ~ ConsciousCode
"So for instance, one possibility would be to just have a hard memory link to code to be run by that block, combined with whatever stack this block inherited" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is actually a pretty reasonable model..." ~ ConsciousCode
"And super small memory-wise......" ~ ConsciousCode
"Blocks are restricted in that they have to refer to the next one and be referred by the previous one right?" ~ EnKrypt
"It'd essentially be: typedef void(*atomic)(void* stack, atomic next);" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the block itself would just be atomic" ~ ConsciousCode
"Got it backwards" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh just next?" ~ EnKrypt
"Like a linked list?" ~ EnKrypt
"Blocks have to refer to previous blocks and are referred to by later blocks" ~ ConsciousCode
"And yes, this is a kind of generalized linked list" ~ ConsciousCode
"technically an "directed acyclical graph"" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can have diamond-like structures too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Another way to think about it is as a tree structure, but with branches being able to recombine" ~ ConsciousCode
"A block can refer to more than one previous block?" ~ EnKrypt
"This past-future direction is actually a requirement, as references are made using hashes" ~ ConsciousCode
"and you can't exactly predict the hash of the block that's going to refer to you" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, just for clarity, in your model, what information do you intend for each block to carry?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm thinking it'll be at minimum the collection of blocks that prove that the computation you're doing is correct" ~ ConsciousCode
"E.g. all the most recent variable assignments, the calling block, etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll skip the protocol stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"A block needs its maximum height" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's the longest number of blocks it'd take to get to the genesis block" ~ ConsciousCode
"This makes timing more evident, since I can make a requirement that all blocks have at least one dependency that has a height one less than the block being made" ~ ConsciousCode
"genesis of all computations, or just the computation it is carrying info for?" ~ EnKrypt
"Then you have the beneficiary hashes (who gets credit for computing and who gets credit for mining)" ~ ConsciousCode
"All computations" ~ ConsciousCode
"This makes it so, say, a node joining the network with an old-ass block it wants to inject would be immediately evident that its block is too old" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since its height would be way less than any of the newer blocks" ~ ConsciousCode
"Next, the id of the process for which this block is being done" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the number of lambdas it'll have left after this computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"A list of dependencies and "fan-in", previous blocks that the block doesn't actually depend on but increase its value" ~ ConsciousCode
"Some structure representing its computation, and finally, the nonce for hash mining" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's also a possible utility to asserting soft memory values within a block" ~ ConsciousCode
"> previous blocks that the block doesn't actually depend on but increase its value" ~ EnKrypt
"How would that work" ~ EnKrypt
"Which lets less popular processes have some mechanism of maintaining their existence" ~ ConsciousCode
"x + 2 = ??? is the newest block" ~ ConsciousCode
"This depends on the block that calculates x" ~ ConsciousCode
"But you can ALSO refer to a block that calculates y" ~ ConsciousCode
"x + 2 doesn't depend on y, but having that kind of arbitrary fan-in makes sure the blockplait is tighter" ~ ConsciousCode
"Huh? making it tighter by arbitrarily refering to random blocks doesn't sound right." ~ EnKrypt
"Tightness here is desirable as it gives more credence to arbitrary blockchains that are valid" ~ ConsciousCode
"So say x is a variable in process A and y is from process B" ~ ConsciousCode
"You might have a long chain of x = somecomputation()" ~ ConsciousCode
"same with y" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, so that would be like saying "Here's x+2, btw just in case, that value there y, is legit, just sayin"?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah kind of" ~ ConsciousCode
"But now, if you look at those two blockchains independently, they have no former root and no connection later on" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since most processes won't address others" ~ ConsciousCode
"So they're essentially two independent blockchains" ~ ConsciousCode
"But something further down with x could refer to y again?" ~ EnKrypt
"The chance of their individual legitimacy isn't dependent on the whole network, only the hashing power of those who computed the blockchain" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yes, but that's unlikely" ~ ConsciousCode
"Google isn't likely to talk to 4chan any time soon" ~ ConsciousCode
"So this arbitrary remixing of states enables the legitimacies to be combined" ~ ConsciousCode
"A block wouldn't be valid if it had invalid referents" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the fact that the fan-in is mentioned at all gives it the blessing of every block afterwards" ~ ConsciousCode
"Rather than just the blocks which refer to y as a dependency" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, that's a new concept to me." ~ EnKrypt
"Sounds neat tho" ~ EnKrypt
"Pushing validity like that." ~ EnKrypt
"Then again, almost every p3p concept is new to me." ~ EnKrypt
"AFAIK p2p networks don't usually have this" ~ ConsciousCode
"Consensus is something that bitcoin essentially invented" ~ ConsciousCode
"And altcoins don't require intermixing validity because there's only one blockchain" ~ ConsciousCode
"This has infinitely many blockchains" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is already a big advantage, since one of bitcoin's design challenges was forks" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is part of why mining is so difficult" ~ ConsciousCode
"It needs to be so difficult that no one has any hesitations accepting the new block as the real one" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, have you written the spec down." ~ EnKrypt
"Stuff you've decided so far." ~ EnKrypt
"Kinda, in the amos whitepaper" ~ ConsciousCode
"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2X2RUIzMOlEIeK00OOt0S2O-MFUHfiKDQqQphAYmAY/edit?usp=drive_web" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also is it contributor friendly?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's not editable but if that becomes a problem you can ask" ~ ConsciousCode
"AFAIK there's nothing that needs to be changed other than wording/grammar and the trust quotient" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, I meant the spec" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, and the block def" ~ ConsciousCode
"Um.. Do you man that the doc can be edited by contributors?" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, I meant the spec. It should ideally be detailed and for the most part spelled out, module by module." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh yeah, I think so" ~ ConsciousCode
"I divided it into sections of relevance" ~ ConsciousCode
"You've got a pretty thick layer of abstraction. Which is nice imo, if you were to pitch this to someone as a project synopsis." ~ EnKrypt
"How do you mean?" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if someone wanted to help you write code, they wouldn't know where to start" ~ EnKrypt
"Right, I barely know where to start" ~ ConsciousCode
"Didn't you create a repo before for it?" ~ EnKrypt
"Should I write a technical spec then?" ~ ConsciousCode
"And... idk actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, I really think you should." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok yeah I do, though I don't think any of the code is useful and it's called amos" ~ ConsciousCode
"What is keccak?" ~ EnKrypt
"It looks like a hash for some reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's the SHA-3 algorithm" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, Imma need to sleep soon." ~ EnKrypt
"I might show the whitepaper around to some guys who I think might be interested.. It's a nice intro to the concept." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, I'll try making a technical spec" ~ ConsciousCode
"Pi's superficial understanding of SSL is kinda cute" ~ k
"if not dangerous" ~ k
"also, it's called TLS now" ~ k
"also, s/RSA/EdDSA/ it's 2016 ffs" ~ k
"also, Keccak sucks, use BLAKE2" ~ k
"TLS uses a different protocol tho right?" ~ EnKrypt
"also, I'm too annoying to have any friends" ~ k
"1.3 removes vulnerability from DROWN and POODLE afaik" ~ EnKrypt

"Help me test botato? :3" ~ EnKrypt

"I tried to stay away from implementation stuff or program structure and more for what needs to be done" ~ ConsciousCode
"botato means the one being booted in esperanto" ~ k
"Booted as in?" ~ ConsciousCode
"K make unamos" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also EnKrypt that's editable" ~ ConsciousCode

"Explanation is good" ~ EnKrypt
"But Idk if skipping implementation details was a nice idea." ~ EnKrypt
"It just seemed like" ~ ConsciousCode
"If I went too far I'd basically be writing it myself" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well you would essentially want to architect it at least." ~ EnKrypt
"I see your point is to give freedom" ~ EnKrypt
"boti woudl be your generic verb derived from noun boto, no dictionaries register it as verb, but looking at other languages including English, I would expcect booting with the meaning of kicking sb with a boot" ~ k

"(definitiely not bootstraping)" ~ k
"k does unamos mean anything in ido or esperanto?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I know they're spanishy" ~ ConsciousCode
"something like "will unlove"... if you try very hard" ~ k
"-os is future tense, ami is love as usual, and I think un is a valid prefix meaning the same as elsewhere" ~ k
"or maybe not, I'm not sure about that un-" ~ k
"So maybe, will love elsewhere?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I meant, I think that un means the same thing as in other languages not that it literally means "elsewhere"" ~ k
"I'd expect un or una by itself to mean 1." ~ EnKrypt
"Well EnKrypt I mashed them together" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's una amos" ~ ConsciousCode
"Amos is itself bad Latin" ~ ConsciousCode
"yeah, unu is 1, but that u isin't a suffix" ~ k

"One boss :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"How would one go about implementing the p2p network?" ~ EnKrypt
"Version 0 sounds simple enough" ~ EnKrypt
"What part of it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"A p2p network is just programs on local computers talking to each other" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, but how would you want to implemented?" ~ EnKrypt
"Well I gave protocol stuff for communicating peer lists..." ~ ConsciousCode
"Who does a peer connect to?" ~ EnKrypt
"How does a peer stay connected?" ~ EnKrypt
"When is a peer said to have lost connection" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm basing this around UDP connections, meaning peers don't talk to each other beforehand" ~ ConsciousCode
"They just toss packets into the ether towards supposed peers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Peers connect via ipv6, which is literally just opening a socket to their address" ~ ConsciousCode
"For flexibility I suppose peers should have both an address and port associated with them" ~ ConsciousCode
"But for early prototypes you can use the 4305 port" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is there a library for this?" ~ EnKrypt
"Node.js has a dgram library" ~ ConsciousCode
"That does low level socket manipulation" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can make a UDP6 socket using that" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then it acts like a stream with streamy events" ~ ConsciousCode
"I still don't get how you'd toss a packet to the ether." ~ EnKrypt
"Here's a packet. Keep hopping this indefenitely" ~ EnKrypt
"var sock = make_udp6(ip, port)" ~ ConsciousCode
"add_recv_events(sock)" ~ ConsciousCode
"sock.send(make_packet())" ~ ConsciousCode
"In pseudocode" ~ ConsciousCode
"Got it. But don't these packets need a target?" ~ EnKrypt
">make_udp6 takes an ip and port" ~ ConsciousCode
"And internally, they're just meant to be passed around until something recognizes it?" ~ EnKrypt
"It sends it to the IP." ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh I thought you were opening a socket." ~ EnKrypt
"I guess it should be two different sockets" ~ ConsciousCode
"One for receiving and one for sending" ~ ConsciousCode
"You make an outbound socket that connects to your peer's IP and port" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well initially, you'd just connect directly" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since we wouldn't have a real network" ~ ConsciousCode
"But longer term, we make peers on static IP servers" ~ ConsciousCode
"You connect to known-trustworthy peers and ask them for more peers" ~ ConsciousCode
"They send you IPs they know about" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, so I hardcode the IP for a single peer?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or parse it from a file?" ~ EnKrypt
"This is what's called "bootstrapping" in p2p" ~ ConsciousCode
"First prototype, don't bother" ~ ConsciousCode
"We can just find our ipv6 and connect directly" ~ ConsciousCode
"But later on, it'd probably be a known list of trusted ips" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like how we have known certificate authorization organizations" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or known DNS servers" ~ ConsciousCode
"in general you'd connect to multiple trusted IPs" ~ ConsciousCode
"That minimizes the risk of joining an unknown network" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, just to start with and get my feet wet, here's what I'll do" ~ EnKrypt
"A node file with maintains list of peers connected to." ~ EnKrypt
"Connectes to a known peer first" ~ EnKrypt
"Gets peer list from it" ~ EnKrypt
"And in turn connects to peers in list" ~ EnKrypt
"Peers aren't "meant" to be long-term" ~ ConsciousCode
"You're supposed to change them like socks" ~ ConsciousCode
"Saving to a file really only makes sense for trusted peers and saving your place when shutting down" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nah, I won't save state." ~ EnKrypt
"At least not in the beginning." ~ EnKrypt
"You mean a .js file" ~ ConsciousCode
"I thought you were going to make a file that stored the peers" ~ ConsciousCode
"node/nodejs" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean like a JSON file that literally has the peer IPs" ~ ConsciousCode
"That might be a good idea for initial list of trusted peers" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok so you got it" ~ ConsciousCode
"k feel free to program for me- I mean make history :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm going to use socketio for this" ~ EnKrypt
"Whatever works" ~ ConsciousCode
"With dgram/dserver if I can integrate" ~ EnKrypt
"Wait what's socketio then?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's like a complete websocket library" ~ EnKrypt
"But I've seen people use dgram with it" ~ EnKrypt
"is dgram not that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Uhh, I'll have to look it up more" ~ EnKrypt
"Anyway you got that" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have work in the morning" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh you're on" ~ EnKrypt
"I wrote up a very basic js file to handle peer logic." ~ EnKrypt
"Connects to a list of trusted peers and in turn connects to their peer lists." ~ EnKrypt
"I thought of having a max peer limit, but to discuss it with you first." ~ EnKrypt
"Whenever you're on." ~ EnKrypt
"In general there should probably be a peer limit since peers are volatile" ~ ConsciousCode
"I imagined that the peer list would be a kind of relevancy stack" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where peers that talked to you got moved back up to the top" ~ ConsciousCode
"So peers you never talked to would sink to the bottom and get discarded" ~ ConsciousCode
"So what decides priority" ~ EnKrypt
"Priority is implicit" ~ ConsciousCode
"Amount of data sent, or how often data is sent?" ~ EnKrypt
"To push a peer up" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, just whenever a valid message is received" ~ ConsciousCode
"Messages are meant to be packets" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just little bundles o data" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, so I'll set it to more often data is sent, it goes higher up the peer rank" ~ EnKrypt
"So what's the peer limit?" ~ EnKrypt
"I was thinking maybe 50." ~ EnKrypt
"But idk how large scale you've planed unamos to be" ~ EnKrypt
"Ugh, I need to sleep. I've fucked my sleep cycle again." ~ EnKrypt
"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-3QJ7mAeLByNmpiaFhxV1pGRnM/view?usp=sharing" ~ EnKrypt
"^ That is the little I've written if you want to take a look" ~ EnKrypt
"Peer limit doesn't matter too much right now" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or even later on" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even if you set the peer limit way too low, all that'll do is make it highly volatile" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically every peer would end up being deleted at least a few times before being readded" ~ ConsciousCode
"There should still be some limit though to future proof." ~ EnKrypt
"There is also another problem. Deciding when to enforce that limit" ~ EnKrypt
"Don't need to enforce a limit" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why would peers need to be forced to have a maximum number of peers?" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you have a supercomputer with infinite RAM, there's no reason to restrict it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because otherwise it would hypothetically be fetching peers till the end of time." ~ EnKrypt
"But ok, if you're convinced that's not necessary atm, we'll skip it" ~ EnKrypt
"It's an implementation detail, not worthy of protocol level" ~ ConsciousCode
""Best practice" maybe" ~ ConsciousCode
"We should eventually do it though" ~ EnKrypt
"idk what's next." ~ EnKrypt
"Tell me if you have ideas." ~ EnKrypt
"I will read when I wake up" ~ EnKrypt
"And you should put something on the repo" ~ EnKrypt
"I can't push or fork it" ~ EnKrypt
"EnKrypt STATUS UPDATE" ~ ConsciousCode
"FRONT ANNNNND CENTER" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you look at the code?" ~ EnKrypt
"I was waiting for you to tell me what's next" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh was there a repo" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, I gave you a gdrive link" ~ EnKrypt
"I totally skipped over it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh nice, I like the config.json" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's a meme nvm" ~ EnKrypt
"I was going to include max_peers as a field too, but I skipped it." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, shouldn't matter too much either way, though max peers would definitely be a good one for production" ~ ConsciousCode
"The reason I was going off on there not being an actual max peers in the protocol was just to avoid unnecessary limitation" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, alright." ~ EnKrypt
"Because someone could make their own Unamos client, it's a protocol" ~ ConsciousCode
"Btw, I haven't tested this: But it should work in theory" ~ EnKrypt
"Well I could set it up on my server and then we could connect to it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hmm, I'd do it on mine too, but the version of node on it is a bit old." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm too used to ES6 to use anything else." ~ EnKrypt
"Less than v6.0 is a no no." ~ EnKrypt
"^Node version" ~ EnKrypt
"I thought you were saying ES6" ~ ConsciousCode
"WHICH STILL ISN'T FINIALIZED FUCK YOU W3C" ~ ConsciousCode
"Node 6.0 onwards inplements ES6" ~ EnKrypt
"I want my guaranteed features ;o;" ~ ConsciousCode
"This site gives a nice ES6 feature comparison chart for different versions of Node" ~ EnKrypt
"What's that trusted IP anyway?" ~ ConsciousCode
"http://node.green/" ~ EnKrypt
"The initial list of trusted IPS" ~ EnKrypt
"The problem is, the current version of LTS Node is v4.5.0" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah but what IP is that in the list" ~ ConsciousCode
"My server's" ~ EnKrypt
"What server" ~ ConsciousCode
"https://nodejs.org/en/download/" ~ EnKrypt
"^That shows the LTS version" ~ EnKrypt
"It's your server" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unless you select "Current"" ~ EnKrypt

"Nice animation" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe a touch overkill :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where'd you get the background?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk ripped it off from somewhere." ~ EnKrypt
"But yeah I went too far." ~ EnKrypt
"It's unprofessional, I'll probably change it soon" ~ EnKrypt
"Although you should vectorize your name there" ~ ConsciousCode
"I made it like 2-3 years ago" ~ EnKrypt
"Atm it looks like you drew it in paint using a mouse stabilizer" ~ ConsciousCode
"It should match the theme" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I need to make my own website too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh EnKrypt, you know Indianese" ~ ConsciousCode
"I know maybe 2 local dialects out of 50+" ~ EnKrypt
"I was wondering the other day about things the Buddha said, like how "attachment is the source of all suffering"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well this is probably mainstream" ~ ConsciousCode
"What about it?" ~ EnKrypt
"Well I was thinkin about it" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I realized that the Buddha really meant /emotional/ attachment" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could imagine desiring something without being attached to it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Say the Buddha went on a 100 year quest to find the best fig" ~ ConsciousCode
"He need not suffer in the process even while he's seeking what he desires" ~ ConsciousCode
"What causes suffering is the conflation of your personal self-worth or identity with the acquisition of your fig" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I was wondering if the language(s) this was originally said in made that distinction" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because English doesn't seem to" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you have source for the original script?" ~ EnKrypt
"Mno, Wikipedia? :y" ~ ConsciousCode
"I only vaguely remember the 7 steps to purification or something according to Buddhism " ~ EnKrypt
"Ok anyway, let's test" ~ ConsciousCode
"Add a console.log(peers) after socket.on('connect')" ~ EnKrypt
"Or rather inside it" ~ EnKrypt
"Like this :" ~ EnKrypt
"socket.emit('list', {});" ~ EnKrypt
"            console.log(peers);" ~ EnKrypt
"Update node on your server if it's older than v6.0" ~ EnKrypt
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up%C4%81d%C4%81na" ~ EnKrypt
"It is also an important Buddhist concept referring to "attachment, clinging, grasping".[3] It is considered to be the result of Taṇhā (craving), and is part of the Dukkha (suffering, pain) doctrine in Buddhism." ~ EnKrypt
"Tanha is definitely emotional" ~ EnKrypt
"And Dukkha is a common word to most dialects: literally just means sadness." ~ EnKrypt
"However, I found this :" ~ EnKrypt
" Dukkha is most commonly translated as "suffering," which is an incorrect translation, since it refers not to literal suffering, but to the ultimately unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things, including pleasant but temporary experiences." ~ EnKrypt
"Ah, so that answers pedants saying "uhhhh, but I can light the Buddha on fire, that's suffering!"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Tanha is actually used mostly in sexual concepts." ~ EnKrypt
"Also, I'm not sure what you mean by "The Buddha"" ~ EnKrypt
"*sexual contexts" ~ EnKrypt
"You know, the Buddha, a Buddha, any Buddha" ~ ConsciousCode
"What is a Buddha lol" ~ EnKrypt
"He was like one dude that existed once" ~ EnKrypt
"It is whatever a Buddha is :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also afaik there's this general sense that everyone's a Buddha" ~ ConsciousCode
"Als afaik, Buddhism rejects deity worship, so "the" doesn't fit well." ~ EnKrypt
"God playing the blind mortal, pretending and playing as if they were going through hardship" ~ ConsciousCode
""God" here being The Experiencer" ~ ConsciousCode
"Of course I'm probably butchering Buddhism, but this is my favorite meta" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not sure that's Buddhism, sounds more Hinduism to me." ~ EnKrypt
"Is Buddhism even a religion?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Everyone's Krishna and everyone would have to reincarnate as everyone else." ~ EnKrypt
"But I don't think they have a well defined "God"" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm just using lazy language here" ~ ConsciousCode
"It isn't a thing to be worshipped" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's The Experiencer, the perception behind your eyes and thoughts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Your life is a movie, and it is the only one watching" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, that's very Hindu-like" ~ EnKrypt
"Probably not Buddhism" ~ EnKrypt
"When you say about lighting a Buddha on fire, do you mean like a statue of Buddha?" ~ EnKrypt
"Here I'm more using "Buddha" as a hypothetical stand-in for the collection of expectations we generally have of Buddha(s)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like with my metaphor with figs" ~ ConsciousCode
"The Buddha never looked for figs, the idea was imagining a Buddha-like figure searching for things in order to clarify our thoughts" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just updated node to the latest, node -v says v0.10.25" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh god, I think you've run into a problem I had before" ~ EnKrypt
"Where you have two different versions of node" ~ EnKrypt
"try node -v and nodejs -v" ~ EnKrypt
"Both work, both give the same" ~ ConsciousCode
"node and nodejs" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, I meant what's the output when you run that" ~ EnKrypt
"THANKS OBAMA" ~ ConsciousCode
"/usr/local/bin/node" ~ ConsciousCode
"And /usr/bin/nodejs" ~ ConsciousCode
"How did you update node?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm going to bet your npm is outdated too." ~ EnKrypt
"Npm can update itself too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah try that maybe" ~ EnKrypt
"npm has v 1.3.10" ~ ConsciousCode
"npm -g update npm" ~ EnKrypt
"You may have to run it twice." ~ EnKrypt
"You would ideally need 3.10.x" ~ EnKrypt
"Maybe I should just purge and reinstall" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not a good idea" ~ EnKrypt
"The repos tend to have older versions" ~ EnKrypt
"Too late :y" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also that's how I downloaded node to begin with" ~ ConsciousCode
"That explains it" ~ EnKrypt
"Even if you do spt-get update and then install node, you might not get later than v4.5" ~ EnKrypt
"Can you extract from .tar.xz?" ~ EnKrypt
"wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.5.0/node-v6.5.0-linux-x64.tar.xz" ~ EnKrypt
"It just has the binaries" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is it safe to just drop these in /usr/bin?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I would think so" ~ EnKrypt
"I got it from node's download page" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean like is that the intended way" ~ ConsciousCode
"If they're binaries, then yeah." ~ EnKrypt
"Prolly in /usr/local/bin" ~ EnKrypt
"Tooooooooooooooooooooo late" ~ ConsciousCode
"node -v is v6.5.0" ~ ConsciousCode
"No just preinstall lol" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I think that's it." ~ EnKrypt
"Quite the pain" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wish npm installed everything in a single directory" ~ ConsciousCode
"It has a tendency to shit out dependency directories everywhere" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you do npm -g install, they usually go in the global node_modules dir" ~ EnKrypt
"Just npm install saves it in the working dir which is kinda like virtualenv in python" ~ EnKrypt
"Good projects, not so nice for just running js files on a whim" ~ EnKrypt
"i need to poo but I need to start this first" ~ ConsciousCode
"Take your laptop with you" ~ EnKrypt
"Or install a ssh client on your phone" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok just gotta go now" ~ ConsciousCode
"XD I shall wait" ~ EnKrypt
"I haven't had a good poo in ages" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you have a good poo now?" ~ EnKrypt
"Those being the ones that you hold for days, hurt like hell but come out totally clean" ~ ConsciousCode
"The poos I've had lately required lots of wipes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which annoys me because that means there's more poo that just didn't come out" ~ ConsciousCode
"Gotta eat more fiber man" ~ EnKrypt
"It's really satisfying to have that kind of POP sensation" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then your colon's empty" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I can't strain to get the rest out because it puts pressure on my head arteries" ~ ConsciousCode
"I connected my client to my server's client, nothing happened" ~ ConsciousCode
"It needs to be on ipv6" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually, I think it'll work with either" ~ EnKrypt
"They're on different networks" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you add the IP to the config.json" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, though I added it as a domain" ~ ConsciousCode
"DNS should take care of it" ~ ConsciousCode
"You might have to put http:// befor eit" ~ EnKrypt
"Still nuttin" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you put a console.log in the code?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or at least I thought I did" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lemme check" ~ ConsciousCode
"Let's just connect directly" ~ ConsciousCode
"Who starts?" ~ EnKrypt
"I will, hang on" ~ ConsciousCode
"My IP should be 2601:14e:c000:1e70:ed00:cb7d:9ba5:61f3" ~ ConsciousCode
"I hope that resolves properly." ~ EnKrypt
"You're port forwarded right?" ~ EnKrypt
"Actually, do you need port forwarding for IPv6?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk if that's because of firewalls or NAT" ~ ConsciousCode
"I.. think so?" ~ EnKrypt
"Internet says IPv6 needs no forwarding" ~ ConsciousCode
"Instantly the best decision for unamos" ~ ConsciousCode
"But they still work with ports" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm going to try to make it so IPv6 is the easiest way to do anything here" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because NAT will make things a bitch" ~ ConsciousCode
"That way, the industry will be forced to change if there's a big adoption of unamos" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I'm not seeing anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm installing dependencies" ~ EnKrypt
"ISPs have been lazy up until now adopting ipv6, since it's cheaper to dig their grave deeper into NAT" ~ ConsciousCode
"And there's no real push from consumers to switch" ~ ConsciousCode
"So we have this weird half and half support, some ISPs support it, all OS and browsers support it" ~ ConsciousCode
"But ISPs, only so far" ~ ConsciousCode
"If there's a killer app that needs it, then there'll be a reason to finally switch" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's been 20 fucking years, I think it's time" ~ ConsciousCode
"Lol I wish it happened here, but there's no trace." ~ EnKrypt
"Also, I don't see anything" ~ EnKrypt
"It being adopted by ISPs here" ~ EnKrypt
"So wait, do you have ipv6 access?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I should have "access"" ~ EnKrypt
"But my address is not." ~ EnKrypt
"Is that how it works?" ~ EnKrypt
"No not generally" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's way more ipv6 than ipv4" ~ ConsciousCode
"It'd be really hard to use it through some kind of ipv4 NAT" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh in that way. No, I don't have access" ~ EnKrypt
"And it's a long while before I will." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok now what? I can't connect" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess we gotta do server to server" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or just use ipv4" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually no" ~ ConsciousCode
"IPv4 has all the port forwarding requirements" ~ ConsciousCode
"But then how do other p2p apps working with ipv4 without port forwarding?" ~ EnKrypt
"They don't :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm pretty sure bittorrent doesn't need port forwarding" ~ EnKrypt
"I have an idea" ~ EnKrypt
"I could create a socket, and send it through to the server" ~ EnKrypt
"The server instead of storing the address, literally stores the socket connection" ~ EnKrypt
"And sends it around when a client asks for its peer list" ~ EnKrypt
"The socketio object from server to client" ~ EnKrypt
"If another client had it, it could send data directly." ~ EnKrypt
"How would another client have it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"The server would pass it around when another client asks for the peer list" ~ EnKrypt
"Again, this is theory. Some technical obstacle might probably be present." ~ EnKrypt
"Describe "pass it around"" ~ ConsciousCode
"socketio can send json objects." ~ EnKrypt
"Or js objects" ~ EnKrypt
"It goes against your packet notation" ~ EnKrypt
"But it might work" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you know about UDP hole punching?" ~ EnKrypt
"That's apparently the recommended technique" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, apparently that is it" ~ EnKrypt
"We'll probably have to ditch socketio" ~ EnKrypt
"We can replicate its interface if that helpps" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's really pretty" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah that's why I used it." ~ EnKrypt
"But that's ok." ~ EnKrypt
"Using dgram was actually a good call." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, scrap it all." ~ EnKrypt
"I'll rewrite this" ~ EnKrypt
"And test it out" ~ EnKrypt
"But, I don't want to send code with gdrive links." ~ EnKrypt
"dgram was just me reinventing the wheel technically" ~ ConsciousCode
"I see some libraries for udp hole punching, and they all use dgram" ~ EnKrypt
"https://github.com/ConsciousCode/unamos" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's empty tho" ~ EnKrypt
"So I can't fork it or anything" ~ EnKrypt
"Add me as a colab?" ~ EnKrypt
"So while you're working on network stuff, should I do protocol stuff?" ~ ConsciousCode
"We need to avoid working on the same file at once" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah that makes sense" ~ EnKrypt
"Any idea what sort of stuff you're going to start with?" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess packet parsing?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does that work?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, so what I'll do is just require('./protocol.js')" ~ EnKrypt
"If so, I'll either need to know your network interface or else have my own interface which hooks into something more central" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or what your file is" ~ EnKrypt
"And then do protocol.parse() where required" ~ EnKrypt
"Could be more modular, but does it need to be?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think more modularity is good" ~ EnKrypt
"And what would you need to know my network interface?" ~ EnKrypt
"Won't need to if we have a central module which uses our individual interfaces" ~ ConsciousCode
"We should maybe have a unamos.js" ~ EnKrypt
"That holds peer.js and protocol.js together" ~ EnKrypt
"So our things need to expose just enough to be useful but general enough to make sense in the code" ~ ConsciousCode
"We should probably have a test suite with >90% coverage" ~ EnKrypt
"Have you done test driven development before?" ~ EnKrypt
"I think it's a great fit for this" ~ EnKrypt
"No, I almost never test my stuff until the end when I fight through syntax errors until it works :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's actyally ok for small personal projects" ~ EnKrypt
"But the larger it gets, the more impossible it is to patch things like that in the end" ~ EnKrypt
"And especially when you're going to make it usable by others" ~ ConsciousCode
"It would be pretty bad if my code allowed arbitrary node code to execute from any peer" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yes, also we could leverage Travis CI into making builds fool proof and checking if contributions meet test requirements" ~ EnKrypt
"So, test driven dev is actually easy in concept but a bit different from how you'd normally write code." ~ EnKrypt
"You essentially come up with a smallest bit of functionality that can be seperated." ~ EnKrypt
"Then you write the test for it *before* you write the code for it." ~ EnKrypt
"And then you keep refactoring the code until the test passes" ~ EnKrypt
"Rinse, repeat" ~ EnKrypt
"to the next module." ~ EnKrypt
"There's a lot of frameworks that help with this, but the standard so far is Jasmine." ~ EnKrypt
"I'll try setting it up for the repo" ~ EnKrypt
"Can you start the project" ~ EnKrypt
"with License and Readme" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, you can't?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'd rather you did it, since you're the author" ~ EnKrypt
"When npm asks for the test command, just press enter" ~ EnKrypt
"Thinking of keywords :" ~ EnKrypt
"computation" ~ EnKrypt
"Author, ConsciousCode and EnKrypt?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think it only takes one author" ~ EnKrypt
"And I'm more of a contributor" ~ EnKrypt
"License... BSD?" ~ ConsciousCode
"How permissive do you want it to be?" ~ EnKrypt
"GPL seems like a fair bet I think" ~ EnKrypt
"What is bitcoin's license?" ~ EnKrypt
"Bitcoin is MIT" ~ EnKrypt
"I do git init?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Too much stuff goign on" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just do the things" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need coffee" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm having trouble focusing because I'm doing a dozen things at once" ~ ConsciousCode
"Talking to 3 people watching a video game wanting coffee and also trying to think of what to do with unamos" ~ ConsciousCode
"Didn't you aldo write a bit of a video game recently?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah that's what one of the conversations is about" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh you already have a unamos.js file" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't think it's what we decided on" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's actually two different API interfaces I thught up combined" ~ ConsciousCode
"Smashed together because I didn't think the new design was good enough to trash the old" ~ ConsciousCode
"It actually has syntax errors" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also, k suggested using blake2 instead of keccak" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, what was his reason?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just out of curiosity" ~ ConsciousCode
"keccak sucks cock" ~ k
"I just read that it was SHA3 and figured that meant it was better (?) than SHA2" ~ ConsciousCode
"who gave you idea sha3 was better than sha2?" ~ k
"anyway, blake is one of sha3 finalists" ~ k
"blake2 is improvement of it" ~ k
"and keccak makes sense in hardware but is shitty in software" ~ k
"also more complicated than needed" ~ k
"What makes it shitty in software only?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll make a peers/ folder and write peer logic there" ~ EnKrypt
"there isn't anything specific that makes it this way, that particular order of operations just is" ~ k
"besides arx primitives are more sexy" ~ k
"Wait I thought I was peer stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or do you mean p2p stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"I thought you were handling protocol" ~ EnKrypt
"And I'd take care of network" ~ EnKrypt
"What do you mean by peer logic" ~ ConsciousCode
"How peers would connect, exchange information" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, but we need to define where that stops and the protocol begins" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's the raw networking, but providing peer lists is part of the protocol" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, any event callback that requires evaluation by the system, I'll leave it out" ~ EnKrypt
"Is there no way to maintain compatibility over ipv4 and ipv6?" ~ EnKrypt
"dgram.createSocket('udp6')" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm guessing that won't work for my network" ~ EnKrypt
"Or my server" ~ EnKrypt
"ipv6 has ipv4 addresses allocated" ~ ConsciousCode
"It is backwards compatible?" ~ EnKrypt
"There's a block of ipv4 addresses in ipv6" ~ ConsciousCode
"explain plz" ~ EnKrypt
"But, there is hope" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's something like fe08::/32" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which means, an address starting with fe0800000000 or so" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just know that 127.0.0.1 = ::1" ~ EnKrypt
"And every address with that pattern is interpreted as an ipv4 address" ~ ConsciousCode
"ffs guys no" ~ k
"So every ipv4 address also has an ipv6 representation?" ~ EnKrypt
"k explain plz" ~ EnKrypt
"much confuse" ~ EnKrypt
"first, fe08::/32 is link-local address, nothing to do with ipv4" ~ k
"::1 is localhost, but it's not the same as 127.0.0.1, or 127.0.0.2 for that matter" ~ k
"Localhost != loopback, yeah" ~ ConsciousCode
"most systems allow using ipv4 through the same interface as ipv6" ~ k
"ipv4 addresses would usually be represented starting with zeros iirc, but let me check that quick" ~ k
"So ipv6 contains all the equivalent addresses in ipv4 and more, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"IPv6 is 128 bit" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it has 2^128 addresses" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is like 10^321" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, got that m8. But is it like backwards compatible, or is a something entirely different?" ~ EnKrypt
"Apparently the underlying protocol is different" ~ ConsciousCode
"::ffff:XXXX:XXXX/32" ~ k
"So you can't reuse old hardware/software" ~ ConsciousCode
"So that means I have an ipv6 address too?" ~ EnKrypt
"zeros, then 16 ones, then ipv4 address; that's what linux does, at least" ~ k
"Ok, so there's all ipv4 addresses can be represented with ipv6, but the converse is not true" ~ EnKrypt
"Also the two networks are different" ~ ConsciousCode
"Something about ipv6 servers not listening to ipv4 requests" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I guess that's not strictly true if you're using an ipv4 extension?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess a quick way to check would be to get ipv6 representation of my server's ipv4 address and see if I can connect to it" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok that works" ~ EnKrypt
"Well that was easy" ~ EnKrypt
"whatismyv6.com" ~ ConsciousCode
"What's this tell you?" ~ ConsciousCode
"That site is exactly what confused me" ~ EnKrypt
"Because it says "I *do not have* Ipv6"" ~ EnKrypt
"That's your ISP then" ~ ConsciousCode
"you probably don't have IPv6 *routing* to the outside world" ~ k
"So I thought they were mutually exclusive" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm not sure what you mean by that." ~ EnKrypt
"I can connect to ipv6 IPs (unless the server explicitly denies my request)" ~ EnKrypt
"It might be that your browser notices that it's in the ipv4 range and just uses ipv4" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need a site that uses ipv6 only" ~ EnKrypt
"if you use something like ::ffff:wha.t.ev.er it does use IPv4" ~ k
"it's suppoed to mean to use ipv4" ~ k
"it just uses ipv6 api interface, but ipv4 protocol" ~ k
"Ok so my concern is that I won't be able connect to peers with ipv6" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm pretty sure my ISP hasn't made any moves towards ipv6" ~ EnKrypt
"if you don't have ipv6 connectivity, then you won't, but that's irrelevant to how you should write your code" ~ k
"also, I'm using a tunnel from Hurricane Electric, you can get one too" ~ k
"actually, that's a good idea" ~ k
"go to ipv6.he.net and complete the certification, you'll learn everything you need there" ~ k
"Ugh, it needs me to sign up." ~ EnKrypt
"like me few years ago :p  https://ipv6.he.net/certification/scoresheet.php?pass_name=mwgamera" ~ k
"Imo, since ipv4 is still huge in most places, I think it's very relevant to how code is written" ~ EnKrypt
"well, duh, it's not a manual, it's fun game" ~ k
"Perfect score lol" ~ EnKrypt
"no, just use ipv6 api, it works with ipv4 too" ~ k
"Wait, holy shit. I'm using my server as a VPN anyway" ~ EnKrypt
"also, for a tunnel, a signup is OBVIOUSLY required, they would literally become your ISP, for free (using the ISP you pay to just for transit haha)" ~ k
"If I can contact DO and ask them to assign a proper ipv6 IP to it, can I just use that?" ~ EnKrypt
"oh, maybe your server have ipv6 connectivity?" ~ k
"I'm 100% sure DO supports ipv6" ~ EnKrypt
"digial ocean?" ~ k
"I just found this https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/is-ipv6-available" ~ k
""IPv6 is now available in our SGP1 datacenter. Check out the announcement for more info and future plans: "" ~ EnKrypt
"so it looks it's possible" ~ k
"That is literally the datacenter I am using" ~ EnKrypt
"and that was 2014, I would expect them to have it elsewhere too by now" ~ k
"Ok, so can I use my server to use ipv6, and then spit it back to me via ipv4?" ~ EnKrypt
"I need to learn this shit" ~ EnKrypt
"if they give you only one adress then you could set up a NAT there; not sure if that's what you want" ~ k
"if they give more, you could set up a tunnel and do normal routing through it" ~ k
"Oh no, I don't need seperate addresses for me and the server" ~ EnKrypt
"Note: You will only be able to communicate with your Droplet with the IPv6 address if you have IPv6 available on your home connection. Both sides of the connection must have this for the routing to succeed." ~ EnKrypt
"wait, they give you ipv4 XOR ipv6?" ~ k
"actually that wording is a bit vague -- is it (communicate with ipv6 address) or (droplet with ipv6 address)?  you sure you can't have both ipv4 and ipv6?" ~ k
"ipv6 is fucking cheap, they should be giving out adresses whenever any of their customers feel like having one" ~ k
"No, I think that's just a warning that the ipv4 and ipv6 networks are incompatible" ~ ConsciousCode
"So if you connect with ipv6 it'll use ipv6 and not your ipv4" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can't bake those assumptions in your server" ~ ConsciousCode
"My server has ipv6 enabled" ~ ConsciousCode
"They don't even charge extra for it" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's just a button you push" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok so that means your server uses both, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"http://parachan.org" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can connect, right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you create your droplet with ipv6, or did you enable it later?" ~ EnKrypt
"Everything is in <?php tags" ~ EnKrypt
"But yeah, it means I can connect" ~ EnKrypt
"I must've forgot to unphp it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I removed paraCHAN" ~ ConsciousCode
"Leaving just the wiki" ~ ConsciousCode
"Too much CP was getting spammed too regularly" ~ ConsciousCode
"And kusaba is a walking security hole" ~ ConsciousCode
"It uses all the ancient PHP stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"Did you create your droplet with ipv6, or did you enable it later?" ~ EnKrypt
"Before they even said "hey, maybe we SHOULD get security experts in here to wrangle the just-learned-C devs"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Enabled it later" ~ ConsciousCode
"PHP must've crashed" ~ ConsciousCode
"I restarted apache" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's still broken" ~ ConsciousCode
"You know what fuck it" ~ ConsciousCode
"No one uses the wiki either" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'll just wrap it up in a barebones db querier and leave it at that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe you forgot to put php in apache.conf" ~ EnKrypt
"I didn't touch apache.conf" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe something else did" ~ EnKrypt
"but the domain parachan.org has ipv4 address only?" ~ k
"No I enabled ipv6 for that too I htink" ~ ConsciousCode
"The AAAA record's set" ~ ConsciousCode
"according to dns1.registrar-servers.com it isn't" ~ k
"Oh, hm, I'll look into that then" ~ ConsciousCode

"in ::1/128, what is 128?" ~ EnKrypt
"The number of bits?" ~ EnKrypt
"Bits of the prefix" ~ ConsciousCode
"So they don't have to list every single 0" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that's implied" ~ EnKrypt
"Since you can only do :: once" ~ EnKrypt
"for every consecutive 0 block" ~ EnKrypt
"It lets the postfix be an arbitrary length" ~ ConsciousCode
"Canonically" ~ ConsciousCode
"So it becomes ambiguous when you want to differ prefixes by trailing zero counts" ~ ConsciousCode
"prefix length has nothing to do with shortcut notation for zeros" ~ k
"What's it for then?" ~ EnKrypt
"honestly, that's the most accurate answer I have" ~ k
"Prefix to what? :I" ~ EnKrypt
"but intuitively, the portion of address that stands for network address and suffix is an address of host within that address" ~ k
"for ipv4 it would often be given in form of a netmask 255.255.255.252 = /30" ~ k
"but technically, prefix means prefix, the portion of address that is used to decide where to route the packages with matching prefix" ~ k
"Ah, with subnet masks." ~ EnKrypt
"Like in ipv4" ~ EnKrypt

"And if we build ipv4 support into this, there's way less incentive to switch" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wouldn't be able to test from my pc and vps as seperate peers" ~ EnKrypt
"But I guess that's ok" ~ EnKrypt
"But dude, there's way too many people using ipv4" ~ EnKrypt
"Are you sure you want to lose that demographic?" ~ EnKrypt
"Anyway, techies are the first adopters" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then businesspeople" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then normies" ~ ConsciousCode
"A lot of techies might not have access to ipv6 even though they might want to" ~ EnKrypt
"They'll have VPSes" ~ ConsciousCode
"By then businesses will have transitioned" ~ ConsciousCode
"Plus, someone will have made a workaround" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it'd work way worse than normal" ~ ConsciousCode
"Actually, workaround is simple" ~ EnKrypt
"Just port forward" ~ EnKrypt
"How simple is that? I've had a lot of frustrations with that" ~ ConsciousCode
"Some routers do it with a click" ~ EnKrypt
"Others have you enter your IP and your port" ~ EnKrypt

"for fucks sake, is the library you are using that shitty or you didn't hear me in the first place, when you write your code for ipv6 it should work fine with both ipv4 and ipv6" ~ k
"you're writting layer 7 protocol (or 4 in tcp/ip model)" ~ k
"it shouldn't matter what protocol is used on layers 1-3" ~ k
"also, techies not having ipv6" ~ k
"of course no ISP in Poland offers IPv6 connectivity, and I use no VPS, but I have uplink to he.net and a convenient /64 to use" ~ k
"regarding NAT-ing and port forwarding, accociating this with choice of protocol it stupid; yes sure, since there are so many adresses in ipv6 that no one should need NAT anymore... should, but we still do firewalls and other shit" ~ k
"and in any case you can add hole punching or upnp support later to help normal users behind NAT that have problems with setting up port forwarding" ~ k
"hmmm... "Trustless, distributed (...)", config.json: "trusted": [...]  :D" ~ k
"Well yeah, it is for those reasons that I didn't really care any more about eclusive ipv4 support." ~ EnKrypt
"And lol I don't know why the description says trustless." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't really get the big idea, but it doesn't have to be a contradiction if these peers are just used to bootstrap things up" ~ k
"Pi, we need to test." ~ EnKrypt
"But I'm not sure how" ~ EnKrypt
"We need at least 3 instances running" ~ EnKrypt
"Connect to me through your VPN maybE?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I need set all that up" ~ EnKrypt
"Just ssh in and run the code on the server" ~ ConsciousCode
"I need to enable ipv6 and configure it and shit" ~ EnKrypt
"And I'm afraid simply enabling it will break certain things" ~ EnKrypt
"It won't if it's DigitalOcean" ~ ConsciousCode
"You just press a button and it'll work" ~ ConsciousCode
"Will I still have my older ipv4 address intact?" ~ EnKrypt
"So what changes?" ~ EnKrypt
"They just add eth1?" ~ EnKrypt
"You have an ipv6 address too" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk how it factors into the eth* stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm afraid if the config for eth0 changes, things relying on it will spaz out" ~ EnKrypt

"Then you haven't" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, I'll back things up tho just in case" ~ EnKrypt

"I just need a small $10M loan from my father :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think that's where we contrast. I like solving challenges that arise from execution too. Gives me an accompanying ego trip that makes me feel like as long as I can think of it, I can also do it exactly like how I thought of it and bring it life." ~ EnKrypt
"Better contact those Nigerian pinces." ~ EnKrypt
"But yeah, if we get this working that might be a viable outcome" ~ ConsciousCode
"I feel like I'm the only person who recognizes the impact this could make" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well, the sample size is small to begin with I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I'm missing how we'd generate revenue." ~ EnKrypt
"Unless we mine lambdas ourselves" ~ EnKrypt
"And tie it to the total net worth" ~ EnKrypt
"We don't ourselves" ~ ConsciousCode
"The way we make money from it is by being early comers" ~ ConsciousCode
"So we make heavily used services that everyone buys into" ~ ConsciousCode
"Imagine if you invented DNS and were the one charging for it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Likw how bitocin was really cheap back in the day?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah kinda, though bitcoin is a bit different since its value actually changes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, that's more realistic" ~ EnKrypt
"Lambdas have intrinsic value which stabilizes them" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh yeah also, what's the video for?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Would you say you have an excess of ego?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because I think I lack too much and I was wondering if that's how we balance" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I've seen you depressed before, which seems like an anti-ego thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also if my motivation is from challenge, why am I perfectly fine watching youtube for hours on end?" ~ ConsciousCode

"I've had the minecraft server for a while, and it had a lot of traffic once from the regulars of the community so I thought I'd just record myself blowing shit up as a way to reexplore the map a bit for nostalgia's sake." ~ EnKrypt
"My depression isn't the self loathing flavor tho. It's more a complete lack of motivation and feeling like everything is pointless. Like I'd still be confident in my abilities, but no will to excercise it." ~ EnKrypt
"What about your fear of others not liking you at school?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I've.. never cared about that?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm pretty sure there's many people who don't." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, could've sworn we talked about that  at one point" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I know you thought they were stupid" ~ Conscious[Work]
"A surprising amount of people disliked me in my last school, I didn't really care." ~ EnKrypt
"But you seemed upset by not having someone" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Yeah, I didn't like tem." ~ EnKrypt
"My social circle exists 99% outside my college anyway, so idc really." ~ EnKrypt
"Good you have some" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Oh I just realized, I legit don't have a "friend" anymore." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm still a friendless loser IRL :P" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ayy, read above." ~ EnKrypt
"I had 2 friends, I lost them both." ~ EnKrypt
"My best friend online is a self-hating cat furry who's going blind from an old person disease" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That actually doesn't sound very dull. We make do with what we have." ~ EnKrypt
"I talk to a lot of acquaintances tho, but it feels really straining because I don't trust any of them implicitly." ~ EnKrypt
"Always on guard" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe make active steps to bringing them closer?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"No motivation. I'd probably just lose them like the people I cared about before, and end up hurting myself." ~ EnKrypt
"Ah ok, if they were good enough for you to be friends you'd be friends already" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's what I tell myself." ~ EnKrypt
"Eh, it's also a matter of time too" ~ Conscious[Work]
"My old bestie took a few years to reach that point" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Hey EnKrypt, do you have a job?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Recently left my last one. Looking actively now." ~ EnKrypt
"What did you do before?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe I could pay you to do this job :O" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Some stuff with MEAN stack." ~ EnKrypt
"What's your job?" ~ EnKrypt
"I have money now so I could totally pay you a Chinese slave wage" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Sounds really unrewarding." ~ EnKrypt
"Why don't you automate the process?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's a human-level job" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Meaning I enter the stuff OCR didn't catch" ~ Conscious[Work]
"At first it was driving me insane" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But then I realized 99% of that was my own extreme expectations for myself" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I was trying to be perfect as quickly as possible, replicating a machine" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But that didn't make much of a dent because the point of this job is lots of people working on the same thing" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So taking a chill pill and relaxing made it not just bearable but kind of ok" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Make better OCR. Sell it to your company." ~ EnKrypt
"I've still yet to make a working AI" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And anyway this is probably temporary" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I got this job partially because my cousin wanted me to help with automating a 40 year old system" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If it's a 40 year old system, using any relatively new OCR tech would probably push the error down by a huge margin." ~ EnKrypt
"Nah it's not that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's the company's core that's 40 years old" ~ Conscious[Work]
"His boss doesn't want me working on it until I'm more experienced" ~ Conscious[Work]
"She's worried that I'll know just enough to cause massive damage" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You sure the OCR is top notch?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, it's almost certainly bottom notch" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Improving the OCR would mean they wouldn't have to spend as much to hire people to enter data." ~ EnKrypt
"They profit, you profit." ~ EnKrypt
"But idk how realistic pull that off would be." ~ EnKrypt
"They're cheap as fuck" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Anyway her worry is legit" ~ Conscious[Work]
"They're reprogramming the core of the company and they have half a month to do it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So even if they could wrangle my mistakes, they need to focus on actually getting it working" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But they're only doing an MVP" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Something to keep the company from instantly losing its ability to function" ~ Conscious[Work]
"After that I might be hirable" ~ Conscious[Work]
"How are you entering the data?" ~ EnKrypt
"A program that shows a pdf scan and has a bunch of missing fields" ~ Conscious[Work]
"As far as workflow goes it's alright" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It could be better if they limited it to one field though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You "guess" what goes in those fields?" ~ EnKrypt
"There's a huge overhead to switching between the different fields" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If it was just one I could look for the same thing over and over again" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Well you're supposed to read it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But some people have really bad handwriting" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Hey EnKrypt how are you restoring your server by deleting it?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I need to reinstall most things anyway." ~ EnKrypt
"But yeah, important files from gdrive" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh so manual even" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Save SQL and scripts and just put them back later" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm thinking about making an Apache-like server in node" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Something that can extend itself" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Extend how?" ~ EnKrypt
"Add files, routers, code, etc" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Node isn't very flexible while running" ~ Conscious[Work]
"At least, you need to add that flexibility" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So expressjs?" ~ EnKrypt
"Express makes it easy to add flexibility" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But not at runtmie" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The problem I've had with node is that it crashes readily, since I'm writing its code" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And it'd be a pain in the ass if every time you added a PHP script, you had to restart the server" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But it's so valuable to switch completely that I need to find a way around taht" ~ Conscious[Work]
"https://github.com/remy/nodemon" ~ EnKrypt
"cool name lol" ~ Conscious[Work]
"In production environments I've seen people use express + grunt/gulp + nodemon" ~ EnKrypt
"So no need to restart, and crash handling and all that fancy stuff" ~ EnKrypt
"What's grunt?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Build automation tools" ~ EnKrypt
"Takes code and churns out release version" ~ EnKrypt
"You have to configure it of course" ~ EnKrypt
"Why don't I ever version" ~ Conscious[Work]
"How often do you push our releases lol?" ~ EnKrypt
"Our releases for what?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Well I mean for personal projects" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Generally I make it work, then break it again and keep debugging" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Also isn't that just git?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You can make a local repo" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Grunt doesn't hold revision history and all that." ~ EnKrypt
"It does things like minifying js" ~ EnKrypt
"sass to css" ~ EnKrypt
"javac - publish to npm" ~ EnKrypt
"You get the idea" ~ EnKrypt
"Though I'd prefer the system do that dynamically" ~ Conscious[Work]
"As in, you request main.css! and it checks versions and holds a compiled version in cache" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Actually just main.css" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Since the user sees it as static" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I like to use ! to indicate dynamic content" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What's left to do with unamos?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Everything?" ~ EnKrypt
"Just connecting peers is done" ~ EnKrypt
"That too just in theory since we haven't tested" ~ EnKrypt
"Quick question: Is n * (2^x) divisible by 2^y?" ~ EnKrypt
"Nvm, math.ceil to the rescue." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah but is that even that much?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What, the peer connecting?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or the remaining?" ~ EnKrypt
"Because I imagine peer connectivity is the most complex part" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The entire protocol needs to be implemented" ~ EnKrypt
"The protocol is tiny dude" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Doesn't it dabble with low level shit" ~ EnKrypt
"It's <version> <command> <payload>" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Command is one of like 5 instructions" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Now an optimal client is a different beast" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That'd take a lot of work because it requires efficient testing of the network" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But an MVP is all that's needed" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Someone else can optimize it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't think the first working version has to be super efficient." ~ EnKrypt
"Most Valued Person?" ~ EnKrypt
"Minimum viable product" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You should do the protocol bit then" ~ EnKrypt
"And then we'll just plug peer and protocol together" ~ EnKrypt
"So there's peer connectivity, packet parsing (protocol), ontology management, mining and computing, and worker control" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ontology is just knowing what variables are what along with hard memory" ~ Conscious[Work]
"All that doesn't sound tiny" ~ EnKrypt
"Computing is just executing a non-looping bit of code and asking peers for hashes" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Mining is just hashing" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And for packet parsing, we might have to switch to dgram over socketio" ~ EnKrypt
"And worker control is just public key signing" ~ Conscious[Work]
"socketio deals with json" ~ EnKrypt
"It maybe exposes raw socket events" ~ EnKrypt
"But that wouldn't be the intended way" ~ EnKrypt
"And we might as well use a library meant for it at that point" ~ EnKrypt
"What does JSON have to do with anything?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"socketio reads and sends JSON" ~ EnKrypt
"But that isn't the protocol I described" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which is why we might have to switch to dgram" ~ EnKrypt
"Blocks HAVE to be binary" ~ Conscious[Work]
"We could perform the parsing on equivalent json data instead, but that will be very inefficient when the overhead is high" ~ EnKrypt
"There must be exactly one canonical version of the block" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Allowing insertion of spaces and no ordering is asking for portability hell" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, so you can get the socket from a socketio instance" ~ EnKrypt
"But idk how you'd perform packet operation on it" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't understand what your obsession with socket.io is" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It doesn't sound like it does us any good whatsoever" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I liked it because all the functionality was abstracted away." ~ EnKrypt
"But ok, it looks like we won't need that functionality anyway" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you want to drop udp hole punching?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, this protocol is designed to be lightweight" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And yes fuck ipv4" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It makes our job way harder" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If there's a huge demand for it then we can lazily implement it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Unless you think we should go for it?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Nope, fuck it" ~ EnKrypt
"It's not actually expensive for ISPs to switch" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It'd cost them $10k max" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But that's that much pocket change they wouldn't have" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So we'll SQUUUUEEEEEZE them" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok so, from my breakdown it still sounds like a lot?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ontology management is a dictionary of (process, address):blob" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You didn't answer" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It doesn't sound like little for sure" ~ EnKrypt
"There'll prolly be a fuckton of issues that only crop up while we're trying to implement" ~ EnKrypt
"And now that I've said it, it sounds a little bigger" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But each individual problem is tiny" ~ Conscious[Work]
"When do you think we'll be done?" ~ EnKrypt
"If we put in like 5 hours per week" ~ EnKrypt
"2201 on Feb 32nd at 25:00" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I've stopped bothering with estimates on my projects since I always end up not doing them" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Lol what did you base this off?" ~ EnKrypt
"Feb 32nd is an impossible date and 25:00 is an impossible time" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And 200ish years is silly" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Oh fuck lol facepalm" ~ EnKrypt
"I thought 2201 was the time" ~ EnKrypt
"This would be nice to write a paper on" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm not academically credible though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Computation as blockchain." ~ EnKrypt
"The project is" ~ EnKrypt
"The whitepaper's about as official as I'll get" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Its computation model is based on my thoughts about Glu" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The latest thoughts anyway" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Chunks of trivial code which link together to form loops and structures" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's necessary for unamos because of the need for parallelization and segmentation (no one computer can compute the entire process)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But in Glu it makes a really nice abstraction, a good balance between other comparable forms and the extreme purity I was going for before where everything was a function" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The blockplait idea is interesting, maybe a paper on that would work" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But idk what to talk about beyond what I present in the whitepaper" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's probably enough" ~ EnKrypt
"And by the time we're done, I'll understand enough of it to write some bullshit myself." ~ EnKrypt
"Why does a paper matter though?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm thinking a well recieved paper is a nice thing to have on a master's/phd college application" ~ EnKrypt
"And that would be a convenient way out of this country" ~ EnKrypt
"College is a scam in burgerland" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm now $20k in debt for no reason" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And I'm at the LOW end of student debt" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm not going anywhere without a scholarship." ~ EnKrypt
"And burgerland isn't on top of my list anyway" ~ EnKrypt
"Maybe after I topple the government by dancing around dressed as wojak" ~ Conscious[Work]
"With Hillary on her way, the odds of that working have also plummeted" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh yeah btw" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I have a twitter for wojak that anyone can tweet with" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Just send a UDP packet to my server and it'll tweet at TheWojak" ~ Conscious[Work]
"/pol/ didn't go for it though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Need more memes" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm seriously considering that wojak thing though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Today I realized I can't support Trump even tentatively because he wants to increase the military" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Like Clinton cheating into the nomination, that disqualifies him as a candidate in my mind" ~ Conscious[Work]
"TheWojak port?" ~ EnKrypt
"She's a crooked lizard" ~ EnKrypt
" /pol/ meme" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean yes @ Clinton but what are you responding to?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Clinton cheating" ~ EnKrypt
"https://twitter.com/TheWojak/status/775745199221927936" ~ EnKrypt
"You can make him follow, unfollow, retweet, and (dis)like" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Just add #{[fur^v]payload to the end of the tweet you send" ~ Conscious[Work]
"CLINTON IS A LIZARD#{r381984791784" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Where that number is an id of a post by Clinton or something" ~ Conscious[Work]
"^ upvote v downvote" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or unlike I guess" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which is only valid for a post previously liked" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This wojak thing would have a lot more impact if I got people from around the country to do it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But I don't think pol would do anything" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Too far on the Trump train" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Idk why you appealed to /pol/" ~ EnKrypt
" /g/ sounds more like your target" ~ EnKrypt
"Fucking keep forgetting / is an IRC escape character" ~ EnKrypt
"For the wojak twitterbot maybe" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But I mean dressing up as wojak and harassing people on the streets" ~ Conscious[Work]

"I watched most of the first season" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Why, do they do something similar?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I know they have the monopoly masks" ~ Conscious[Work]

"I'm doing data entry" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I need to figure out what to make wojak do" ~ Conscious[Work]

"But I can't do that with one demonstration" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You need people" ~ EnKrypt
"The Chinese will do" ~ EnKrypt
"So I need a plan, list of things to do when how and goals to go for" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Yeah, just lure them in with some weird cuisine and anime porn" ~ EnKrypt
"No wait that's the Japenese" ~ EnKrypt
"dun matter, chinki = chinki" ~ EnKrypt
"Those Asians are also inherently smart." ~ EnKrypt
"But at like math and shit, not strategy" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean start an internal struggle" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Wojak makes people wake up and realize that this election is between the two most hated candidates in history" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Wait are you being srs?" ~ EnKrypt
"Make them wake up and realize everything that's wrongh" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And that they can fucking do something" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Might be a manic episode" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You know there's a third option, right?" ~ EnKrypt
"Everywhere is corrupt EnKrypt" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This is the norm atm" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And America for all its disease still has SOME free speech" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Plus this isn't just my sentiment" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm fairly certain the majority are pissed at the status quo and would go through a lot to fuck it up" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But they "can't" because no one's started anything" ~ Conscious[Work]
"There's no opportunity to do things" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Just shambling along to the election" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You underestimate how barbaric and primal the majority is." ~ EnKrypt
"They'll complain about everything" ~ EnKrypt
"And be pleased about everything" ~ EnKrypt
"If you really are being realistic, it'd make more sense to just go elsewhere" ~ EnKrypt
"Outside any government influence." ~ EnKrypt
"That's stupid" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Why wouldn't I try this?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Because I don't see this realistically working" ~ EnKrypt
"Unless you're really good at manipulation" ~ EnKrypt
"At which point you've become corrupt yourself" ~ EnKrypt
"The point is to push a domino" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Public inspiration is a bad thing to rely on" ~ EnKrypt
"Think about it another way" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This is my vote" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Rather than throwing it away or not doing it at all, I'll try to use it toward something that will hopefully matter" ~ Conscious[Work]
"How is this the same as a vote?" ~ EnKrypt
"It has theoretical political significance" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's me representing my opinion" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Having my voice heard, which is supposed to be the point of voting" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But no vote can be my voice" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This would be the same as you voting for the none option in the voting booth or however you guys vote" ~ EnKrypt
"Practically insignificant" ~ EnKrypt
"Except you're telling everyone about it" ~ EnKrypt
"Which makes it more valuable" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The options presented are grin and bear it, vote for someone I don't like, or do something which MIGHT have any impact whatsoever" ~ Conscious[Work]
"There's no personal cost to me beyond time and a little cash for the suit" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which I think is going to be about the time it'd take to vote" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Not valuable enough though: That's my point" ~ EnKrypt
"I know I sound like a cunt." ~ EnKrypt

"Doing something that MIGHT help is better than doing nothing which is guaranteed to not help" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What you're arguing with is exactly why nothing happens" ~ Conscious[Work]

"And then no one tries anything at all, and shit just keeps getting worse" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If you don't even try, you deserve your hell" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Because you chose it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's better to spend time coming up with a better strategy than wasting it on failed endeavors." ~ EnKrypt
"Doing something that is 90% not going to work is actually counter productive" ~ EnKrypt
"Since you could optimize using that time in other ways instead" ~ EnKrypt
"Tell me a better strategy then" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Because this is the best one I've ever thought of, because I've yet to come up with anything" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Well it'll take time." ~ EnKrypt
"I've always just wanted to fuck off from this planet. Literally." ~ EnKrypt
"You say that as if I only just started thinking about this" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But seriously why the hell would I not?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Like I said, there's no consequences" ~ Conscious[Work]
"No excuse to not fling shit at the wall and see what sticks" ~ Conscious[Work]

"I don't care about either" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Both are insignificant" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The costume I talked about costs $10 max" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Been thinking about how unamos DNS works" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I think we'll want to make it before anyone else joins" ~ Conscious[Work]
"All it really is is a process that associates domains with processes" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So essentially, you're paying it to hold that association" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ideally though, there'd be a good balance between squatters and snatchers" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Squatters being people who buy a domain and never give it up" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And snatchers being the opposite, people who buy domains the second they're available and hold them for ransom" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Squatters need limits on how long a domain can be held" ~ Conscious[Work]
"To impose restrictions like that we'll have to be ICANN registered and shit." ~ EnKrypt
"We're not really a domain registrar" ~ EnKrypt
"How would you even know if someone is squatting vs actually using it?" ~ EnKrypt
"Also most registrars manage basic DNS too. If someone has a domain what incentive do they have to use our DNS servers?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm pretty sure "unamos DNS" is different thing than the "DNS"" ~ k
"and it probably isn't supposed to require ICANN blessing" ~ k
"Though thinking on it some more, technically DNS could be used for unamos" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But this way it can be made... freer? Less corporate?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Wait, what is a domain in "unamos DNS"?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah possible, that's what I thought you meant." ~ EnKrypt
"it's probably stupid idea because actual DNS isn't that good as a protocol, but you might want this as a compatibility layer" ~ k
"Wait so you think we shouldn't make an unamos DNS?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And EnKrypt that'd be something like" ~ Conscious[Work]
"una://yourdomain/path" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Where yourdomain only makes sense in the unamos network" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And these would point to processes?" ~ EnKrypt
"Processes being roughly equivalent to servers" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Oh so like actually hosted stuff" ~ EnKrypt
"Although una:// is a intent URL" ~ EnKrypt
"Will you be making it browser accessible?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, ideally this'd replace traditional client-server models" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Though not necessarily HTTP" ~ Conscious[Work]
"How would you make it browser accesible tho?" ~ EnKrypt
"una:// won't work" ~ EnKrypt
"Unless you have some extension that filters that intent" ~ EnKrypt
"Why won't una:// work?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Not recognizable intent to a browser?" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh wait right" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That describes protocol, not accessibility" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I think it'd just need to have a special format then?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Something unambiguously not the old URI format" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The problem with URI is processes aren't actually servers" ~ Conscious[Work]
"unamos.com/foo/bar?" ~ EnKrypt
"They're more consensus.... bubbles with deterministic state transition" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Imagine typing that every time you went to any website" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You can't type the unamos domain because those don't exist outside unamos." ~ EnKrypt
"EnKrypt, the point of unamos is to replace the internet as we know it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Client-server is still viable, but it'll work in a radically different way" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, but how will it be accessible?" ~ EnKrypt
"As a replacement the ultimate goal would be for browsers to adopt it as the primary addressing protocol" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, in that case we could have a chrome extension that handles it simply" ~ EnKrypt
"Right though you need to be a peer in the network to access it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So for now it'd require a local node server + a chrome extension" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or else localhost:port/bla" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That doesn't hold with unamos domains" ~ EnKrypt
"Rather than una://domain" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh that's just a shim" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Not permanent, just how you could theoretically address it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7087728/custom-protocol-handler-in-chrome" ~ EnKrypt
"Chrome requires web- as a prefix IIRC" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But that answer is 2 years old" ~ EnKrypt
"Also thinking more on it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"HTTP is actually obsoleted" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So una:// makes sense" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's addressing components in the unamos network" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Er, data, whatever" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, but how to implement?" ~ EnKrypt
"torrent magnet links work" ~ EnKrypt
"But letting the OS handle it" ~ EnKrypt
"same for mailto" ~ EnKrypt
"It doesn't actually matter how we handle it though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's all superficial" ~ Conscious[Work]
"localhost:port/path works even if it's ugly" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It'll just be replaced later on as unamos becomes standard" ~ Conscious[Work]
"does [::1]:port/path look better? ;)" ~ k
"But even then, howLol" ~ EnKrypt
"Not by much, but I'll try to find a workaround for una://" ~ EnKrypt
"If it requires register a handler with the OS, so be it." ~ EnKrypt
"Or you could fork Chromium and add it yourself" ~ Conscious[Work]

"I know I'm not a bad person in the moral sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"By definition even, I think" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I know what you mean" ~ EnKrypt
"It's more an evaluation of my worth" ~ ConsciousCode

"Should others care?" ~ ConsciousCode
"If not then why do I stick around?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why am I even feeling this, I'm medicated" ~ ConsciousCode

"I can somehow block that part out with some shitty rationalizations." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't have a purpose" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or at least I've learnt to" ~ EnKrypt
"I have a purpose, I gave myself one but" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can only think about it when I can't act on it" ~ ConsciousCode
"That isn't a purpose then, it's a distraction" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't create, I fantasize" ~ ConsciousCode
"Fantasies aren't reality, they're worthless until acted on" ~ ConsciousCode
"I am my ideas, I am worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
"It is a very effective coping mechanism." ~ EnKrypt
"To fantasize" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes but why cope? I have no purpose" ~ ConsciousCode
"Coping is for living, living takes purpose" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I can do anything" ~ ConsciousCode

"By the time whatever you send it through takes its "exchange fees", it'll probably be down to $80" ~ EnKrypt

"I'll probably never use it, but I always wanted to have actually money in my bitcoin wallet" ~ EnKrypt
"No, you can't really buy bitcoins in the US without selling your soul" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You need to give them your SSN to ensure you don't try to cancel your credit transfer while keeping the coins" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I think that depends on you're buying it from." ~ EnKrypt
"I could pay you in lambdas :P" ~ Conscious[Work]
"In here it's as simple as a netbanking transfe" ~ EnKrypt
"Every place requires that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's probably because where you are, transactions aren't cancelable" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's the tricky bit" ~ Conscious[Work]
"People can cancel bank transfers, but they can't cancel bitcoin transfers" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So they need to make sure that if you steal from them, you can never do it again" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I think we have something called a reverse charge" ~ EnKrypt
"Alternatively, if you ever want a vidya game on Steam I could buy it for you :P" ~ Conscious[Work]

"I'd be too paranoid to use it" ~ EnKrypt
"It could be made really low-powered by having a piezoelectric component that touches the eardrum directly" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Buuut, the primary issues are power and connection" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Traditionally that'd be bluetooth" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But Bluetooth eats batteries" ~ Conscious[Work]
"My Mi band is super efficient" ~ EnKrypt
"When I had MIUI" ~ EnKrypt
"I could do radio I guess" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But then I have to carry around a radio dongle" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You could use bluetooth only" ~ EnKrypt
"Again, power is an issue" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ideally this thing wouldn't even have batteries" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Since it's relaying vibrations to vibrations, you could have it powered by vibrations" ~ EnKrypt
"Which is actually not so bad if I do the piezoelectric thing" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Since piezos primarily do sound through solid structures" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or a tiny magnet and coil" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But again, how do I connect to it?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"connect what to what?" ~ EnKrypt
"Say my computer to my headpiece" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This isn't just a reverse-hearing aid, I want to use it for computer sound too" ~ Conscious[Work]
"My armpit's itchy and I've caused a cut on it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So now it stings when I scratch but it still itches" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Again, bluetooth" ~ EnKrypt
"Again, Bluetooth eats batteries alive" ~ Conscious[Work]
"There's no way I'd get enough power for it from vibrations and acceleration" ~ Conscious[Work]
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_low_energy" ~ EnKrypt
"Imo I think that's enough" ~ EnKrypt
"Since you're going to "use" energy only in the form of peizoelectric or whatever" ~ EnKrypt
"Well not much to think on now" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The next idea;" ~ Conscious[Work]
"A few nights ago I had a fever dream of a manic episode while trying to fall asleep" ~ Conscious[Work]
"During which I was thinking about how to solve the battery crisis" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That being that battery progress has been at a near standstill for decades" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The idea is a magnetic spring" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Take two extremely powerful but tiny neodymium magnets" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Arrange them so they're repelling each other and can't flip around" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Fix one in place and let the other move" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And surround that system with a coil of extremely thin wire" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This system is simultaneously a solenoid and an acceleration-energy source" ~ Conscious[Work]
"(it can be used as either)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If you activate it as a solenoid and push the magnets together, you're adding energy into the battery" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Turn it off, and the hope is that eddy currents will lock the magnet in place" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That is, if the magnet tries to move away, it'll cause a current in the wire which pushes it back" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That wounds like it'll require a 100% energy conversion efficiency." ~ EnKrypt
"Also, I don't think we have to wait for a decade." ~ EnKrypt
"https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4fys88/scientists_accidentally_create_batteries_that/" ~ EnKrypt
"The only way to allow the magnet to bounce away is to complete the circuit" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Although the comments seem to indicate that it's more of a capacitor than a batter" ~ EnKrypt
"So you can use it as a battery, as completing the circuit would generate a current" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And the amount of energy used is directly related to the movement of the magnet, which is limited by that energy" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But how much current?" ~ EnKrypt
"The higher the resistance, the less the magnet can move" ~ Conscious[Work]
"At least in theory" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Right, so it's still a 1:1 ratio for conversion." ~ EnKrypt
"I haven't done any calculations for this so idk if it'd even work" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Also, inertia" ~ EnKrypt
"Loss of energy will probably be a huge detterant." ~ EnKrypt
"I think inertia can be ignored" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Very small mass + very low speed = near zero inertia" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But yes that'd probably be a drain on the power storage" ~ Conscious[Work]
"All batteries lose energy with time" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The biggest for this would be the magnet pushing away more than the eddy currents can push it back" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Basically the spring losing tension" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Incidentally, this is also what could make or break this idea" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't know how powerful eddy currents are" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or if I'm even thinking of their direction correctly" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So it might be that the battery would lose its stored energy near instantly" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't suppose I could ask you to run some calculations for me? :O" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Are you talking about transient currents?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or induction?" ~ EnKrypt
"Also, that sounds more like a capacitor than battery" ~ EnKrypt
"What sort of caulcations?" ~ EnKrypt
"Eddy currents are what slow down a magnet when it travels down a nonferromagnetic tube (like copper)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The motion induces currents in the metal which count the movement of the magnet" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's a kind of magnetic inertia of sorts" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Capacitors use a very specific construction style" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Storing charges on parallel plates with a dielectric between them" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Anything that isn't that isn't a capacitor" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And calculations would be the energy density, the maximum viable energy storage, and the longevity of a stored charge" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Technically there's no limit to how much energy you could store in this" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But there IS a point where the energy stored and the energy lost becomes useless long-term" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I.e. you give it LHC levels of magnetic power to push it femtometers close, but it instantly jumps to a few microns because the repelling is significantly stronger than the eddy currents" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok I think you can model this as a literal spring" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Where B is the magnetic force and x is the distance between two magnets" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But idk how to model the eddy currenst" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It should be a counteractive force, which is weird because the force only exists where there's movement" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But in a superconductor, even an impulse would be exactly countered..." ~ Conscious[Work]
"(it's break time btw)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"countered by the same force?" ~ EnKrypt
"Are you sure?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, Wikipedia said R = 0 => perfect responses" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That is, magnet movement vs eddy currents" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So you'd expect a magnet in a superconductor solenoid to remain at rest unless pushed" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Then again I guess that push would add to the counter-effect?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe the heat from the eddy currents would diminish superconductor properties" ~ Conscious[Work]
"F_e = vB^2A/(rho/t)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"v is velocity, B is the magnetic field, A is the magnet's area, rho is the resistivity of the conductor, and t is the thickness" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Thickness more applies to this particular equation" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Er, experimental setup" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ugh, break's over" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And I think this'd be better solved with calculus" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So I guess I'll do it myself later" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Still, neat idea" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It scales with its size and has minimal wearing" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Was that an Ice cream company?" ~ EnKrypt
"It was started by two broke yokels who couldn't get a job" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And quickly became one of the most successful indie ice cream businesses in the country" ~ Conscious[Work]
"They were champions of social justice - they used something crazy like 60% of their revenue to tackle humanitarian problems" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It was part of their brand even, you knew that eating their ice cream contributed some to the betterment of the world" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But lo and behold, they had financial issues in their rise to power" ~ Conscious[Work]
"To get through the Winter, they sold cheap as fuck stocks to all citizens in the state they were based in" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Everyone was happy to help, it was a source of state-pride" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But then corporate America set its greedy, beady little eyes on it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"A company bought the stocks from everyone in the state in one fell swoop, buying out their entire company" ~ Conscious[Work]
"They were booted from their CEO jobs without their consent, their company stolen from them" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And the humanitarian efforts, while retained to some degree, were lowered to $1M/year (<1% of their revenue)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That was to keep the brand alive" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Afaik you don't have to make majority shares publicly tradable" ~ EnKrypt
"My teacher tried to tell us the lesson was that their humanitarian efforts, any at all really, were too costly to stay in business" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which is fucking bullshit" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The lesson was, yeah that actually" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Never ever ever ever ever ever EVER make >50% of shares publicly tradeable" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Yeah alight agreed lol" ~ EnKrypt
"And if at all possible, make it actually Impossible due to the beaurocracy to even sell those private stocks" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But even <50% public is bad" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's why companies are money optimizers" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Companies optimize revenue to satisfy shareholders" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Why is that bad. Money optimization is actually nice as long as it is within my moral green light" ~ EnKrypt

"Money optimization as the primary/only utility" ~ Conscious[Work]
""Yeah we'll kill 10,000 people by doing this, but we'll make a few million extra dollars!"" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Money optimization is amoral, not immoral" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It optimizes for things which aren't necessarily moral" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This is why nonprofits I feel are necessary" ~ Conscious[Work]
"They're companies that don't optimize for money, but rather non-monetary goals" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I actually looked it up a few months back. It is perfectly valid for a non profit to generate revenue" ~ EnKrypt
"The difference being that all that revenue has to go directly into making that organization/company function" ~ EnKrypt
"What makes a non-profit "not for profit" is that there isn't someone at the top who can skim as much as they want from the top" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Now, I'm not sure if keeping some of that revenue as your "allowance" is a valid loophole here or not" ~ EnKrypt

"What did you do?" ~ EnKrypt
"How Glu could make the best OS" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or OS base I guess" ~ Conscious[Work]
"All executables are compiled to Glu, then JIT'd to native" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Instant portability, all applications become native (provided they have a Glu compiler)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"On top of that, since everything is being compiled by the OS, it can guarantee that nothing is touching memory it's not allowed to" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Since Glu doesn't have any semantics for pointer arithmetic or raw system calls or anything else dangerous" ~ Conscious[Work]
"JIT sounds resource intensive." ~ EnKrypt
"If you have to keep ding it for everything" ~ EnKrypt
"So everything can run in kernel mode, which means way less overhead for switching" ~ Conscious[Work]
"JIT follows the 80-20 rule" ~ Conscious[Work]
"JS is nearly as fast as bad C these days" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And Glu is better optimized for real computers" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Plus it's also really expensive to be constantly switching back and forth between application mode and kernel mode" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And this allows processes to share resources and even code" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I just have to, y'know, write Glu" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I think I'm better equipped for it now, but I'm still searching for the perfect assembler pattern" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I want to use as few passes as possible for Glu -> native" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe I should go the V8 route and have IRs for targets?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Hydrogen (their version of Glu) compiles to Lithium (architecture-specific IR)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So JS -> Hydrogen -> Lithium(x86) -> x86" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Actually yeah that's probably the best approach, because then I don't have to predict common patterns for native code" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok this'll be my thoughts for the rest of the day I think" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Unamos doesn't have much else to think on" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I wonder if I'll have a manic episode today" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't think I'm quite there yet" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Wait EnKrypt, do you know how JIT works?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Jus in Time compilation?" ~ EnKrypt
"Sort of, but explain anyway." ~ EnKrypt
"Well it's where you take code of some form and compile it right before you execute it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Compile to native, thatis" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And the next time you call that code, it's already compiled so nothing else is needed" ~ Conscious[Work]
"JIT has overhead, but it's not so significant that it'd show performance losses vs the performance gains of runtime optimizations" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I asked because it sounded kinda like you were thinking it recompiled every time code was called" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If I open something that performs JIT" ~ EnKrypt
"Close it then open it again" ~ EnKrypt
"It will still have to do JIT right" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah generally, no idea why though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You can save your progress pretty easily" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I guess because it's not worth it?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Oh, when I say "call the code", JIT tends to operate on the function or block level" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Like V8's JIT will unroll loops while they're running, stuff like that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Not the whole program, which would just be AOT compilation but done just before" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Do you ever have trouble finding a comfortable sitting position?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"For some reason I can't be comfortable unless my legs are crossed somehow or I'm lounging, like a lion" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And then I have to switch legs to avoid cutting blood flow" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And lounging fucks up my elbows" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I alternate between knees up to cheest, lying on one side and then the other." ~ EnKrypt
"How do you type like that?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or see the screen" ~ Conscious[Work]
"My knees reach up to my nose maybe." ~ EnKrypt
"I can see fine" ~ EnKrypt
"And hands around knees" ~ EnKrypt
"You're on your side, so the screen is tilted to you" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And if your arms are around your knees, no typing" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm not on my side" ~ EnKrypt
"When I'm on a side, I don't keep my knees up lol" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh well I'm always on my computer" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So when I lounge, my computer's right there" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Am I the only one who paces around my room a lot?" ~ EnKrypt
"Like that's why I've made sure there's not much in room. It's not huge, but I've carefully left out space so I can walk around" ~ EnKrypt
"No, I do that when I'm waiting and thinking" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If I'm thinking really passionately I'll walk in tight circles around stuff like counters" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I thought I was the only one who did that :O" ~ EnKrypt

"Generally I'm too lazy or I keep myself grounded with youtube videos" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Oh it just occurred to me" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You're so cautious, especially for your age" ~ Conscious[Work]

"And have died a lot" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I can't remember if you were this cautious before you reported the experience" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Cautious how?" ~ EnKrypt
"Well just the way you seem to approach life" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Like yesterday you were advocating waiting at the side for a better opportunity when there wasn't any actual costs to trying" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Idk I guess that's more of a general impression than something I can point to" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So ignore it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm more trying to start conversations because work is pretty dull" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Oh place your bets now, will I do anything after work?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Odds are 99 to 1 "nope"!" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But I guess that's dependent on manic-depressive symptoms at the time" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I really don't remember much about before that experience happened." ~ EnKrypt

"Well I actually have a trick to tackling problems like that" ~ EnKrypt
"They moved my desk" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I even had a name for those kind of problems: Where you want to do x, but you've never done x before so you don't really have failures to learn from and optimize" ~ EnKrypt
"But you have a good understanding of x itself and you've seen others do x, but actually doing it involves calculating with certain variables that you don't know itself." ~ EnKrypt
"What if it's nothing BUT failures" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's huge." ~ EnKrypt
"If you've failed you have data" ~ EnKrypt
"Very relevant data" ~ EnKrypt
"But I'm assuming you've never actually made an impact on the world?" ~ EnKrypt
"At least not one that "counts"" ~ EnKrypt
"I'd say maybe JQ is closest with when Palavar went wild." ~ EnKrypt
"Right, so my trick is to assume you've already completed x successfully. And you're giving advice to a younger self on how to repeat it" ~ EnKrypt
"Kind of like how right now if I was given the chance to go back in time and repeat high school, I would do things very differently." ~ EnKrypt
"What about that is different from just thinking on it?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But those were not things I learnt because of high school. I already knew them. I just didn't apply them right because I didn't have the perspective of "Revisiting them"" ~ EnKrypt
"Is is a subset of thinking on it" ~ EnKrypt
"This doesn't solve the problem directly." ~ EnKrypt
"It generates entropy for you to approach the solution faster rather" ~ EnKrypt
"faster/better whatever" ~ EnKrypt

"Do you want to make palavar for code?" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm sick of typing code structure when I already have it in my mind" ~ EnKrypt
"And anything to speed it up would be great" ~ EnKrypt
"What you're actually asking for is really more of a human readable programming language" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Well I don't either. Just thought you might have." ~ EnKrypt
"Well see, as long as it can understand what part of the code does what, it can add to it or modify it on command" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess you could get a similar effect with an extensive macro system" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Though that's not as cool" ~ Conscious[Work]
"We could base it on palavar" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But it'd have to be a lot smarter" ~ Conscious[Work]

"If you remember, palaver was really simple" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Just google's voice API + a command-based natural language parser" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It was Siri but extensible" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So there's not much to add" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That was actually really intuitive" ~ EnKrypt
"Taking a simple concept and succeeding in selling it" ~ EnKrypt
"Btw if it uses Google's voice API does that mean you can't use it offline?" ~ EnKrypt
"Unless google made an offline version" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But code isn't that simple" ~ Conscious[Work]
"We'd have to be a lot more clever" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What was palaver'c logic?" ~ EnKrypt
"Recognition bias towards specific words?" ~ EnKrypt
"Like "mode" or "palaver"" ~ EnKrypt
"Or was simply having definitions and running your voice input through the parser?" ~ EnKrypt
"I think it was just <Command> <payload>" ~ Conscious[Work]
"With some filler word parsing too" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, we can make that." ~ EnKrypt

"Pft, just teach it English" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Do you think we can use things lke Jedi or Tern itself?" ~ EnKrypt
"But I don't know ido" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Have you Jedi or TernJS?" ~ EnKrypt
"The fuck are those" ~ Conscious[Work]
"They are basically intelligent code analyzers." ~ EnKrypt
"Also used for autocomplete (and maybe linting also) in code editors" ~ EnKrypt
"Jedi:Python::Tern:Node" ~ EnKrypt
"Unless they're extremely generalized, I don't think you could adequately get them to understand English, right?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe cobolese" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Plus that only gives you the semantics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You also need to convert that to actions" ~ Conscious[Work]
"No, I mean that's ok. We'll write the English to code sensitive action parser" ~ EnKrypt
"But idk how we'd integrate jedi/tern after that" ~ EnKrypt
"How would we even do actions?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Also we could use the Watson API to help with the English to code action conversion" ~ EnKrypt
"Something probably like 'Select editor; perform these keystrokes'" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess Jedi/tern could be used to parse code it's already generated so it can follow references (e.g. "change dummy to foo")" ~ Conscious[Work]

"But how is that different from if(data != value) throw Error(...)?" ~ ConsciousCode
"That being native and thus more intuitive" ~ ConsciousCode
"In some special assertions, you get more helpful error messages" ~ EnKrypt
"Also, a failed assertions doesn't stop everything" ~ EnKrypt
"You have some special matchers you can't have with native code" ~ EnKrypt
"And anyway, the point was to introduce you to test driven dev, jasmine is a library that does that" ~ EnKrypt
">special matchers you can't have with native code" ~ ConsciousCode
"My problem here is this really doesn't explain test driven development because I don't understand the testing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like when you want to match if a code throws an exception" ~ EnKrypt
"But you've said it yourself" ~ EnKrypt

"I need to go to bed" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, I'll share tomorrow then" ~ ConsciousCode
"isn't that exactly what you would expect from library? abstract out code that you would have to write repeatedly?" ~ k
"Yes but it does so in an incredibly obtuse way" ~ ConsciousCode
"Abstractions only work if you understand what they're abstracting" ~ ConsciousCode
"idk about jasmine, but usually they give you some boilerplate to get nice error messages (like value was X, expected Y), but also summaries, setup/teardown of test fixtures (think databases, mock objects, other shit), etc" ~ k
"hey, chantard, do you have any idea what "t." is supposed to mean? in context like this https://8ch.net/pone/res/259027.html#259126" ~ k
"I've seen it 2-3 times by now, but still haven't figured out what does it mean" ~ k
"No, I think I've seen that too but only rarely" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also hey..." ~ ConsciousCode
"Although in context, it looks like it roughly means "I have a reason for making the previous assertion"" ~ ConsciousCode
"but why t, is there a word for this that starts with t? therefore would be backward" ~ k
"https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/4seari/what_does_t_word_mean_on_4chan/" ~ EnKrypt
"There is. The word you're looking for is some Finnish word starting with t" ~ EnKrypt

"it is the first time I see reddit being useful, though" ~ k
"Surely, you jest?" ~ EnKrypt
"Reddit > 4chinz" ~ EnKrypt
"At least productivity wise" ~ EnKrypt
"4chan has more banter and memes maybe" ~ EnKrypt
"Reddit has more circlejerks" ~ ConsciousCode
"A lot of the time, it can identify the circlejerk and turn it on itself." ~ EnKrypt
"That is where there is a lot of satire circlejerk subreddits" ~ EnKrypt
"Which then become their own circlejerks" ~ ConsciousCode
"The problem being that people can see who other people are and how much "street cred" they have" ~ ConsciousCode
"Reddit is a giant popularity contest, and it suffers from all the downsides" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've noticed that most of the time, no one checks your karma." ~ EnKrypt
"Unless you're one of the top accounts, no one even gives a crap who you are." ~ EnKrypt
"Also karma is "supposed" to filter out bad content" ~ ConsciousCode
"But what it actually filters out is unpopular content" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well they are not 100% mutually exclusive." ~ EnKrypt
"It does that job, but not perfectly." ~ EnKrypt
"But no, it doesn't suffer from being a popularity contest." ~ EnKrypt
"If that were the case, people with more karma would continue getting more karma and people with less would find it really hard to" ~ EnKrypt

"What do I tell someone who does't trust that global warming is a thing?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't tell him he's "objectively wrong" because "all the facts point to such and such" because in actuality, I've done just as much research as him" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's actually said that to find something out, don't ask a question. Instead write something down that's slightly incorrect. You'll get an answer sooner." ~ EnKrypt
"Keep asking him why until he's forced to do research" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm serious." ~ EnKrypt
"But see, my dilemma is that subjectively speaking, we're equally correct" ~ ConsciousCode

"I've know for ages now that I'm powerless in the vast stormy sea that is real life" ~ ConsciousCode
"I barely have control over my own life, I work twice as much as I relax" ~ ConsciousCode
"So such big problems as "global warming" and "ess-jay-double-yous" and presidential elections" ~ ConsciousCode
"The only thing I can change about those is my reactions" ~ ConsciousCode
"So arguing on and on and on about these near metaphysical factoids as if they're relevant is not just a waste of time, it's an affront to rationally spent time itself" ~ ConsciousCode

"Why are you having manic episodes? Does your psychologist or whoever know about it?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, I'm guessing its side effects from the latest meds" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's concerta, a focus drug for ADHD" ~ ConsciousCode

"Dude you can't trade one mental handicap for another." ~ EnKrypt
"Lower your dosage or something" ~ EnKrypt

"Only that one crash post-manic, which was cured by social interaction" ~ ConsciousCode
"that'll be the first thing I tell him" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well you should know how badly its affecting you" ~ EnKrypt

"Oh yeah EnKrypt" ~ ConsciousCode
"I made a simple test library" ~ ConsciousCode
"http://pastebin.com/Aj2HK7SP" ~ ConsciousCode

"But I think those are extremely important to have" ~ ConsciousCode
"Untested though" ~ ConsciousCode
"Gotta sleep. I'll take a look when I wake up." ~ EnKrypt
"So how's my test library look EnKrypt?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I did think of some updates that'd make it better" ~ Conscious[Work]
"test takes an array, but it SHOULD take an object with each test name as the key" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I miss waking up in the morning." ~ EnKrypt
"What advantages has your test library over jasmine?" ~ EnKrypt
"Not Invented Here?" ~ EnKrypt
"ya, he doesn't like jasmine because he doesn't understand what it does and why" ~ k
"I understand everything about my library" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It does all the things I need it to" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And it does so in an elegant way" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And it only took like an hour to write" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I ..know you can make a test library Pi. One of the points of using a library was so that you wouldn't have to" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, and now I don't have to :P" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You still have a little way to go before you can say that." ~ EnKrypt
"What's it missing?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Asynchronous handling." ~ EnKrypt
"Preset timeout - in case of async stuff or really long loops" ~ EnKrypt
"You're right actually, though moreso for Node.js' callback hell than anything else" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I actually thought about that while writing it, thinking promises could be used" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Might just do that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Are you *sure* you don't just want to use something that already does that?" ~ EnKrypt
"Show me one that does, EnKrypt" ~ Conscious[Work]
"One I can actually fucking use" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Why exactly can't you use jasmine?" ~ EnKrypt
"*Because I don't understand it*" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And btw there are many other test frameworks" ~ EnKrypt
"Mocha comes to mind" ~ EnKrypt
"So talk about that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I've already told you many times that Jasmine as a test framework doesn't make any sense to me" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't understand what anything its syntax sugar is trying to do" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Afaik though they're all mostly the same." ~ EnKrypt
"And a library you can't understand is one you can't use" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe the words used are different" ~ EnKrypt
"You write specs with assertions" ~ EnKrypt
"And maybe involve spies." ~ EnKrypt
"The syntax sugar is just syntax sugar. You're trying find functionality out of syntax sugar." ~ EnKrypt
"keve mes te deva la?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm guessing it had some purpose to make things simpler for some people, but ok maybe that doesn't apply to you. So look past it?" ~ EnKrypt
"Nanko, shuri phif" ~ Conscious[Work]
"vai? Te gane veen!" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, go ahead and use a strawman metaphor to convey a non sequiter" ~ EnKrypt
"Oooh, you used the fallacy fallacy" ~ Conscious[Work]
"A single fucking word" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It makes *no* sense to me" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's not a fucking strawman" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I am incapable of using it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What pisses me off most about this is you seem to be totally incredulous that this is even possible" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You can't stand the idea of moving on to something different so you're trying to force me to use something I can't understand on any level" ~ Conscious[Work]
"https://mochajs.org/" ~ EnKrypt
"The syntax is 75% the same." ~ EnKrypt
"So I'm guessing this isn't helpful either." ~ EnKrypt
"Well let's just see if 25% makes a fucking difference" ~ Conscious[Work]
"http://chaijs.com/" ~ EnKrypt
"I see this as the equivalent of someone not being able to learn by reading a book" ~ Conscious[Work]
"75% same, but a different 75%." ~ EnKrypt
"And the school system says "well fuck you then, that's all you get"" ~ Conscious[Work]
"When they'd be much better off learning it by the teacher saying it, or however they learn" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You're telling me that the way I understand things is wrong" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's why it pisses me off" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You've misunderstood me somehow." ~ EnKrypt
"How do you want to learn?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's a higher level association" ~ Conscious[Work]
"In this case, learning vs comprehension of syntax" ~ Conscious[Work]
"They share a domain" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You've written your own library which does nearly the same. Minus some extra stuff that jasmine has." ~ EnKrypt
"Because the presentation /matters/" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You're learning the same thing reading a book vs doing it in class vs hearing your teacher say it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But different people understand things more readily in different ways" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Jasmine is presented in a way which makes its semantics unintelligible" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Do you want to get past the presentation, or avoid jasmine altogether?" ~ EnKrypt
"Because then this won't the same as someone not understand the way the teacher teaches it, it'd be more like the student not wanting to learn it at all." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't mind using a different library for the sake of convenience, but they're all mostly the same, which is why I don't see the point." ~ EnKrypt
"It looks like chai has 3 different syntaxes for assertions, so maybe look at that?" ~ EnKrypt
"Although if you look past the syntax all 3 do exactly the same, but since it's the syntax you're hung up on.." ~ EnKrypt
"It seems you've never used a library with a shitty interface then" ~ Conscious[Work]
"EnKrypt, the POINT of a library is convenience" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If I feel that it's easier to homebrew my own library than figure out Jasmine, then Jasmine isn't worth looking at" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You do realize how telling that is btw, right?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Alright, but that is an antipattern." ~ EnKrypt
"I found it easier to /make my own version/ than to figure it out, it was THAT incomprehensible" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Since now we have to indrectly test code for testing code." ~ EnKrypt
"I have never heard anyone say that, but alright." ~ EnKrypt
"There's literally just "describe", "it", and "expect"" ~ EnKrypt
"But ok, whatever works." ~ EnKrypt
"Golly gee what a retard Conscious is" ~ Conscious[Work]
"He can't even understand what English means" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's almost like their usage is contorted to the point where their English semantics are almost totally unrelated" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I get that, but why are you trying to relate it to how you would use English?" ~ EnKrypt
"They "tried" to make it so, it probably turned out horribly." ~ EnKrypt
"And it's causing a problem for you, so ignore it." ~ EnKrypt
"Because that's what the library was designed around" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe this is because English is my first and only language" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So you're able to distance yourself like that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But I just can't, not on the level they require" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's like trying to unhear the meanings of words" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, so imagine those words don't have inherent meaning themselves, and they're just there as placeholders." ~ EnKrypt
"Will that also not work?" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't know what they're placeholders for" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Well I can tell you that." ~ EnKrypt
"Their words are supposed to make them self-documenting, but I neither understand the documentation nor its usage" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If you want me to explain?" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok so describe is a function that takes a string as argument1 and callback as argument 2." ~ EnKrypt
"Think of it as a "set" of tests." ~ EnKrypt
"You can have subsets too. Put another describe function inside a describe function." ~ EnKrypt
"It is mostly for convenience so in case there is an error, you know which set or subset it came from." ~ EnKrypt
"When you're done having sets to seperate tests, you write the tests themselves." ~ EnKrypt
"You do that with the 'it' function. Takes string as arg1 and callback as arg2." ~ EnKrypt
"Inside that callback you do your testing." ~ EnKrypt
"You abstract it such that you have an 'assertion' where you have an input and you know the right output for it beforehand." ~ EnKrypt
"So now you use the 'expect' function. It takes the output as arg, and uses a matcher function with input as arg." ~ EnKrypt
"Like expect(input).toBe(output)" ~ EnKrypt
"When this code is hit, the framework decides if your tests passes or not, and comes out of the 'it' callback to the next." ~ EnKrypt
"ouch, I though pi was complaining about some TDD slang but I just looked up jasmine docs and it's realy awful, I wouldn't having to use it either" ~ k
"The English they tried to cram with the syntax is poorly done, yeah." ~ EnKrypt
"It's important to keep in mind that I'm always the unreasonable one" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Babby can't handle a bad interface" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Trying to figure out what mad me so spitting mad" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Usually I only get mad/frustrated with communication issues" ~ Conscious[Work]
"there is some precedence with using "it" as default iterator variable in some languages, but it's a shitty name for anything; here these should be just tests, describe should be named "suite", because ffs describe what, and that methods named to* are pure madness" ~ k
"It probably was a communication issue. I assumed you were saying 'the syntax is horrible, so I won't use it even though i understand it'" ~ EnKrypt
"Lol yeah. To check !condition, you write expect(in).not.toBe(out)" ~ EnKrypt
"I can't say it wasn't a communication issue because I can't say what the difference between that and my actual problem was" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If there was one" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The null hypothesis is that this was a temper tantrum and I'm just emotionally infantile" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And my therapist says self deprecation isn't helpful" ~ Conscious[Work]
"How else do you keep a child in line than by telling them that they're unloved by everyone when they misbehave?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That sounds.. cruel." ~ EnKrypt
"Only the best for baby Hitler" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's probably how you ensure he's behind mass genocide." ~ EnKrypt
"I have this memory of when I was 3 maybe, and out of the blue, unprompted I started to cry because I realized my parents didn't love me." ~ EnKrypt
"They told me that was not the case, but when I think about it, I wasn't completely wrong." ~ EnKrypt
"Parents don't love their children, they love their genes" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If they loved their children, it'd be based on who and what they are, not that they're related by blood" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok brb, changing desks" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Musical office spaces" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Pi, need opinion." ~ EnKrypt
"There's this service that let's you complete a code challenge, they evaluate it, give you a score and then connect other companies to you to get a job." ~ EnKrypt
"They gave me a 3.5 out of 5 on evaluation. Tbh I did a lazy job." ~ EnKrypt
"But I can probably push it up to 4.5 although it'd take me one or two days" ~ EnKrypt
"Do you think I should try interviews with that score itself or push my score up first?" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't see why you wouldn't try to improve it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Time. I don't want to waste any more of it." ~ EnKrypt
"I've already done a week long project last month to have a company turn me down.," ~ EnKrypt
"They gave you a project?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"An evaluation project. Some companies do that." ~ EnKrypt
"That's pretty shitty if it took that long" ~ Conscious[Work]
">inb4 they just used you as an intern without giving you resume fuel" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Yeah. If I ever see them using that code tho, I will definitely sue." ~ EnKrypt
"But it wasn't a complete waste. I learnt ReactJS along the way atleast. That's my rationalization." ~ EnKrypt
"Why do I need to create something so bad" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's not for the notoriety" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I just want these things to exist" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or anything that I made to exist" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's normal lol" ~ EnKrypt
"Pi fuck can we make that code factoring bot." ~ EnKrypt
"I am legit finding typing out mundane syntax to be a bottleneck to my productivity." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah I can see it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But idk how to do it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"JQ would tell you to use Lisp" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or we could make Glu" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe. We'll have to think about it." ~ EnKrypt
"That'd let us use any syntax we want easily" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Well actual translation should be easy." ~ EnKrypt
"The understand what you've said and turn that into an understandable command might be the hard part." ~ EnKrypt
"Apparently the way Viv does it is with intent translations" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Specific intents are broken down into their components until it has something that can process it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So "What wine goes well with spaghetti" would be too specific, no one wrote a handler for that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So it becomes wine going well with {noodles, Italian, sauce}" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Although you might be able to use Viv as code refactoring when it comes out" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Maybe we can use nltk or whatever" ~ EnKrypt
"Actually draw out a list of "compatible" intents with this kind of bot" ~ EnKrypt
"Also need some kind of command language" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Generate a program for the bot to follow" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or just a scripting language?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Nah, it should be a bytecode" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What will this program do?" ~ EnKrypt
"Viv generates a program on the side while decomposing the semantics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Then executes it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This allows 3rd party developers to tell it to use their highly specific API to order flowers etc" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Problem I see EnKrypt" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It seems like in the time we take to develop something like that, we'll already have advanced AI that outpaces anything we make" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So we both agree that AI doing everything is the general direction where progress will happen for sure." ~ EnKrypt
"We could technically use that to jump on the bandwagon before everyone else." ~ EnKrypt
"And seize a portion of the market." ~ EnKrypt
"But we don't have an AI to speak of" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Everything I've done with AI was theoretical" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Time to apply" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't know if any of my ideas even work" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't even have that much experience" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, step 1?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Would probably to recreate palavar" ~ EnKrypt
"Without commands" ~ EnKrypt
"Just the base" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm not sure how useful palaver would even be for this domain" ~ Conscious[Work]
"We need voice to AI first tho yes?" ~ EnKrypt
"Although if we make an AI, my request is that it be named Asriel and have an avatar of a cute goatkid" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Nah, I'd just do text to AI" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Voice can come later" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I can be the mommy, and you can be the daddy" ~ Conscious[Work]
"<-- Goat mom" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Now DUN TOUCHA DA CHILD" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Lol undertale?" ~ EnKrypt
"10/10 on steam wat" ~ EnKrypt
"Wait what seriously" ~ Conscious[Work]
"There's no one who ever downvoted it?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Anyway what's the actual step 1" ~ Conscious[Work]
"nltk got that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Have a set of verbs that make sense to the AI" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess those will be the intents?" ~ EnKrypt
"Hmm, just verbs won't be enough" ~ EnKrypt
"Wait do you want it to learn or just do stuff?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's another thing" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok tell me the difference between training in machine learning and learning in AI" ~ EnKrypt
"Training is a distinct step" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Learning would, theoretically, be training while working" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Though it's very seldom done in practice" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, so learning is sort of like training in situ?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah I guess" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But that means at the beginning it will be a turd." ~ EnKrypt
"Though I think they tend to be interchanged, since live learning isn't really used" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's to prevent your AI from unlearning your careful training" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Yes, as with all AI" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That puts things into perspective." ~ EnKrypt
"Do we have the AI run on the cloud?" ~ EnKrypt
"Collective learning from everyone using it?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or local AI with a seperate instance for every project you "open" with it?" ~ EnKrypt
"That depends on the architecture, and we don't have a cloud" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'd suggest something like Cortana" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Local to the computer" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But Cortana isn't retarded the first time you open it." ~ EnKrypt
"We'd have to apply training only to this somehow" ~ EnKrypt
"Take your project, go through it. Learn it without working" ~ EnKrypt
"And then unlearn/learn as you go along changing code" ~ EnKrypt
"Unlearning should be a thing. If you remove a part of your code, you should no longer otimize for it." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh right you just wanted a code monkey" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I was going off on gen AI" ~ Conscious[Work]
"In which case don't call it Asriel" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Have you considered writing libraries?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And libraries for?" ~ EnKrypt
"Whatever boilerplate you're frustrated with" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Well here you're talking about having the AI optimize the code, and know where all the symbols are and what functions and types are and" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's just very domain specific, we'd have to either invent gen AI or give it specific ontologies which would make it fragile" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I just can't imagine how to make something which takes commands in English and modifies code using those commands" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Uhh, are you assuming this AI would work for all languages?" ~ EnKrypt
"Viv is kind of a halfway point between specialist and gen AI" ~ Conscious[Work]
"No, just English" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I was thinking of making a different one for each language" ~ EnKrypt
"Programming language" ~ EnKrypt
"I was like "hmm wait, you can't make Hindi variables in C"" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You can in JS though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Well if it supports unicode you prolly could" ~ EnKrypt
"No I mean variable names" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Honestly I say wait for Viv" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But Viv won't be open?" ~ EnKrypt
"It sounds like they're making it an embeddable platform rather than just a Siri" ~ Conscious[Work]

"One day ( '-')" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Do you think 40 hr/wk work schedules are... "natural"?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I was thinking on this last night" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's 8.5 hours of work every day" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I need exactly 9 hours of sleep to function" ~ Conscious[Work]
"People here go around 60" ~ EnKrypt
"But they also get paid a lot, so.." ~ EnKrypt
"And it takes me half an hour to get to work" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So all in all, I have 4-5 hours of free time a day" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which doesn't seem amenable to having friendships or a "life"" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Imo that's enough free time." ~ EnKrypt
"Especially considering work is literally twice as much your life as rest" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You can have a proper social life with that little time." ~ EnKrypt
"But the thing is" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I use it as I may now, but I try to socialize with my cousin (basically a friend)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"By the time we see each other, we're both exhausted from work" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So not much but staring and mumbling really happens" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Weekends are better at least" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But I don't think you actually can have a healthy social life within that time given the mental overhead of working" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't feel like I'm living a life here" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It feels more like I'm being exploited so I live to work" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So when I say "natural", I don't mean relative to society (40 hr/wk is the norm here), I mean relative to human nature and social needs" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I think 8 hours per day is optimal" ~ EnKrypt
"At least for me." ~ EnKrypt
"I think you're missing what I'm saying" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't enjoy these 8 hours" ~ Conscious[Work]

"I'd normally recommend changing your work to something you enjoy then." ~ EnKrypt
"But you've had problems with getting a job before." ~ EnKrypt
"Thing is I don't have any reason to live" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Life is not valuable to me" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What's valuable is the experience and circumstance" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So I have no reason to work solely to survive" ~ Conscious[Work]
"My parents don't seem to understand this at all - they seem to think this is suicidal thinking" ~ Conscious[Work]
"My dad went so far as to say my philosophy on the value of life was caused by my depression" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And was thus invalid" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Put yourself in circumstances that where you find the experience valuable." ~ EnKrypt
"Would if I could but I can't so I won't" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You probably came across as "I don't value living" rather than "life as such isn't inherently valuable to me"" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't see the difference" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I continue living for things I value other than life" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The former implies that you value not living." ~ EnKrypt
"Uhh, it shouldn't. But that's what it probably came across as." ~ EnKrypt
"People tend to think in dichotomies unless instructed otherwise." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, what's that called" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Something like the antecedent implies the inverse" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's a fallacy" ~ Conscious[Work]
"One that's tricky to communicate in English for some reason" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I guess logically that's ~L(V) = L(~V)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which is contradictory for, er" ~ Conscious[Work]
"~V(L) = V(~L)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Not value living = value not living" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Yeah, in casual conversations I make those assumptions too." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't think I've recognized myself as following that pattern" ~ Conscious[Work]

"I'm not thinking too hard btw so idk if those are actually valid examples" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Uhh false dichotomy is one thing" ~ EnKrypt
"Moreso it's venting I guess" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Confusing earth for the rest of space is pretty huge leap" ~ EnKrypt
"I think it's more ambiguous language + people not attempting to interpret words as the most reasonable/valid interpretation" ~ Conscious[Work]
""Of course there's no aliens!" -> taken literally, they're right" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But in context it's not meant to be literal" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which seems to be dying for some reason" ~ Conscious[Work]
"These days it seems like people are eager to debunk others by taking the least reasonable interpretations of their words and arguing against those" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'll bet this is the patriarchy's doing >:O" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or less sarcastically, tribalism" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I've given my spiel about tribalism here I think" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Context holds a lot of weight. When you're talking normally, I'd optimize to understand the message being conveyed as it was in your head." ~ EnKrypt
"On the other hand when we're having a discussion, logical or semantic, I optimize for analysis/interpretation of the point instead." ~ EnKrypt
"It's more of a social instinct." ~ EnKrypt
"Both are optimizing for mutual understanding" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But for different reasons, so the method is different." ~ EnKrypt
"If you try to disprove something someone said but didn't think, you aren't arguing against anything" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If you're trying to disprove someone, you shouldn't take things literally and analyze the interpretation." ~ EnKrypt
"But if you're just talking normally, it's ok to assume things." ~ EnKrypt
"But how else am I going to wiiiin?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You should take it literally" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't think that's true even" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Talking normally should be treated the same as debate, for mutual understanding" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So assumptions should be made reasonably and with concessions that they may be incorrect" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Talking normally and debate should never be treated the same lol." ~ EnKrypt
"I'd say that indicates lack of certain social skills." ~ EnKrypt
"Unreasonable assumptions are ok imo if taking things literally is not critical." ~ EnKrypt

"= Stacy hates me" ~ EnKrypt
"A literal interpretation would reveal that is a fallacy" ~ EnKrypt

""Aliteral" more like" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Reading between the lines" ~ Conscious[Work]
"While I'm talking fast, I tend to convey things "aliterally". Don't have time or energy to semantically verify everything I say" ~ EnKrypt
"So I give everyone that same space too" ~ EnKrypt
"Unless we're having a debate where literal interpretations might be necessary" ~ EnKrypt
"I guess in debate people are "supposed" to say things less figuratively" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Could it be" ~ ConsciousCode
"Checking if it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Has its own" ~ ConsciousCode
"If the key is IN the object, we could say????" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yes, because otherwise it would also iterate through inherited properties." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh that's actually something you're distinguishing?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not sure foreach iteration goes over inherited keys though" ~ ConsciousCode
"You just said "if I have to type this-thing-that-I've-almost-never-seen-because-it's-so-rare-to-need-it again I'll puke" or wahtever" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, I keep using that." ~ EnKrypt
"And it is annoying" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok now what are you looking to avoid iterating over?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because builtins have no-iter on their methods" ~ ConsciousCode
"Meaning foreach doesn't pick up on those keys" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hence why for(var x in "aoijiweg") { console.log(x); } is a no-op" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even though strings have members, their methods" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've read that foreach is supposed to be a bad habit" ~ EnKrypt
"Well that might not be true actually" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hory shit what" ~ ConsciousCode
"It actually enumerates those" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean yes you're not supposed to use foreach on arrays" ~ ConsciousCode
"And who would want to anyway, it gives you the keys instead of the values" ~ ConsciousCode
"But foreach is still fine for stuff like object literals" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yer keepin me up" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm going to go to bed" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah I should probably too." ~ EnKrypt
"And tomorrow I'm going to ask you why the fuck you need to enumerate objects that have prototype chains in the first place" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it's noon for you" ~ ConsciousCode
"My sleep cycle is fucked" ~ EnKrypt
"Because aparently that is the recommended way." ~ EnKrypt
"Idk if ES6 brought some new shit that helps with this" ~ EnKrypt
"That's the way for dumbasses lol" ~ ConsciousCode
"You shouldn't iterate over objects that have prototype chains" ~ ConsciousCode
"foreach is basically only for object literals" ~ ConsciousCode
"It breaks near instantly when you use it on more complex objects" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess they say you should do that to promote code reuse for if you ever want to use a complex object as a literal where it wasn't originally intended but" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's probably always unnecessary" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I'm deal with inherited objects. I'm guessing those have prototype chains" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes they do, but why are you using foreach on their properties?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also try Object.getOwnPropertyNames" ~ ConsciousCode

"I have a much more finalized mental model of how it'll work" ~ Conscious[Work]
"oh wow, I didn't realize they are also registered in Poland; we have more important problems to fix before I would even consider voting for them, though" ~ k
"and fwiw, there are no "objects without prototpyes in javascript", you're just lucky that Object has no properties marked iterable by default" ~ k
"> Object.prototype.foo = 1;" ~ k

"(that's also why some people who aren't brave enough tell you you should never touch prototypes of Object, String, Array, etc)" ~ k
"So the answer is use Typescript? :P" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Since it's JS but with sane semantics?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Finish espresso!" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which isn't JS but has some of its semantics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"k let's talk about something, I'm bored" ~ Conscious[Work]
"answer is use Map when you need a map and plain objects when you need plain objects" ~ k
"Or keep doing what I do because it works and won't stop working in the future?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"all these languages like coffeescript, typescript, whatever are really silly coping mechanisms for people that actually hate javascript but have to use it because web" ~ k
"Google wants Typescript to be a replacement for JS rather than a compiles-to-JS" ~ Conscious[Work]

"hopefuly not gonna happen" ~ k
"Why? Don't like it?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't know enough typescript to say there's anything wrong with it per se, but we have enough mess already and adding another language isn't helping" ~ k
"Well obviously, the issue is the web doesn't have Glu yet" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If it had glu it could run any language :O" ~ Conscious[Work]
"where were some attempts on creating some bytecode format for web iirc" ~ k
"Yes, ongoing" ~ Conscious[Work]
"asm.js is the old one, wasm (web asm) is yet to be released" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But they aren't Glu" ~ Conscious[Work]
"asm.js wasn't a bytecode, though, it was restricted subset of javascript proper and didn't require any special handling to work if browser didn't want to bother" ~ k
"And really they aren't even necessary - wasm's only advantage is low-level primitives like fixed-width ints" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That and parsing, but afaik that's minimal time usage" ~ Conscious[Work]
"parsing is done only once so not a big deal, and v8 has a shitload of nasty optimizations that make it run reasonably fast optimizing shit like unnecessary type conversions out, but this makes it insanely complex" ~ k
"you don't want insanely complex software with known (and fucking desired) RCE bugs" ~ k
"browser is essentailly one big RCE bug" ~ k
"So it avoids the nasty optimizer" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What's an RCE bug?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"remote code execution" ~ k
"So you think it's actually huge?" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Actually V8 could probably do that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Why don't they? Oh yeah, google" ~ Conscious[Work]
"fwiw, secirity probably isn't the thing that drives people actually working on that, they probably want to squeeze out the rest of the performance that is wasted for dynamic analysis wthin optimizer, sure expected runtime is nice because more complex analysis kicks in for more complex programs only, but you know, can be improved by not having to do it in the first place, or by letting some compiler do it " ~ k

"Just realized glu works on the assumption that all targets have a small number of intrinsics which are a subset of the glu intrinsic set" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The glu intrinsic set has alternate implementations for all implementable intrinsics in case that intrinsic isn't available" ~ Conscious[Work]
"If an intrinsic isn't implementable and the target doesn't have it, it's some kind of IO and it shouldn't compile anyway" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Otherwise it breaks down the dense Glu graph into simpler representations that are renderable by the target" ~ Conscious[Work]
"A lot like Viv...." ~ Conscious[Work]
"It breaks down a highly specific/complex intent into its fundamentals until it finds handlers" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Although this does require it to start at a higher level" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Have you tried asking yourself why?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, it's the same with all my projects" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So I don't know" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Also, is it time to learn you some Glu?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What do you think it is, in your own words?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't know really. I originally assumed it's disparity and bias towards certain cognitive functions." ~ EnKrypt
"Like people who love reading, but don't write at all." ~ EnKrypt
"Because those are two very different processes." ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, no I meant glu" ~ Conscious[Work]

"Better case is drawing" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Everyone wants to but no one does" ~ Conscious[Work]
"They care on a superficial level, not a passionate level" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's a hybrid language that can compile to any other?" ~ EnKrypt
"But you are passionate." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeh, so it's not that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That was the original glu" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's grown over the years to something much more elegant" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's a kind of virtual machine, of sorts" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Though its code isn't meant to be run directly" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Its code uses intrinsics which correspond to extremely high level functions" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So for instance, it might have a matrix-multiply intrinsic" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or a system-of-equations-matrix-solve" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Along with low level stuff like multiplication and mod" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Having so many intrinsics means there's always going to be a fairly simple way to represent any code as glu" ~ Conscious[Work]
"(so it's easy to compile to)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And every (computable, not IO) intrinsic has a simpler implementation that comes with it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"(so it's easy to compile out of)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Using this, you can compile to glu and then out of glu from and to any source or target" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Essentially, you can transpile anything that's sanely computable" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The examples I tend to use are windows exe to Linux elf" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or wii/PS3 roms to executables" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or high level driver code to native (anything becomes installable)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Or scripting languages to native (instant speedup of anything you write an interface for)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You just have to remember that it's not magic - it guarantees identical computation, not prettiness" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So gluing asm to C won't magically give you sane variable names" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm not sure what you mean by instrinsics." ~ EnKrypt

"You were right, rand is an intrinsic in most languages" ~ Conscious[Work]
"These are functions that have no in-language definition, they're just there" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You know what they are and what they do even though you don't know what the actual implementation is" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, so what happens to function that do have in language definition?" ~ EnKrypt
"So they're treated as these blackbox functions" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That's made of intrinsics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So it's just a collection of them" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Well I'm sure there's some functions that aren't." ~ EnKrypt
"And are language specific" ~ EnKrypt
"It's by definition though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"All code is expressed within a language using that language's intrinsics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So it stands to reason that a function implemented within the language is made of a collection of those intrinsics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"For instance, function hypot(x, y) { return Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y); }" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That uses the intrinsics Math.sqrt and *" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It isn't possible to write a function that uses definitions that aren't either defined as part of the language or implemented within it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Are you sure you can replicate everything with intrinsics?" ~ EnKrypt
"If that is true, I'm wondering why this doesn't exist." ~ EnKrypt
"Give an example of something not made of intrinsics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Also, how will you know what those intrinsics are?" ~ EnKrypt
"You'd have to see the source of those functions" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean yes, it only covers computable functions" ~ Conscious[Work]
"There's no intrinsic for does-it-halt" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But what you call an intrinsic is arbitrary for languages" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You could call hypot an intrinsic there if you just didn't touch it afterwards" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It's like the definition of a lisp atom" ~ Conscious[Work]
""A lisp atom is either a terminal or it's a pair"" ~ Conscious[Work]
"All of lisp comes from that" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok we'll take a turing complete but stupidly simple language" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Its intrinsics are + - < > . , and []" ~ Conscious[Work]
"[] not so much but it's there" ~ Conscious[Work]
"There's nothing you can make in BF that doesn't use those intrinsics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"By definition" ~ Conscious[Work]
"How's that sound?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Yeah got it" ~ EnKrypt
"BF to any other language sounds criminally simple." ~ EnKrypt
"How would you do something like "JSON.parse" to BF?" ~ EnKrypt
"BF has no intrinsic for JSON.parse" ~ EnKrypt
"Are you saying you'd have to first reduce it to the intrinsics of JS" ~ EnKrypt
"And then convert that to each corresponding BF intrinsic?" ~ EnKrypt
"(system-of-equations-matrix-solve, oh you mean ⌹ [read: quad divide])" ~ k
"Do you know what "turing complete" means?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Mmm, remind me?" ~ EnKrypt
"It's the property of a system of rules being capable of computing anything that"s computable" ~ Conscious[Work]
"that's beautifully circular definition" ~ k
"BF is turing complete" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It can compute anything that's computable" ~ Conscious[Work]
"JSON.parse is computable, soooo" ~ Conscious[Work]
"BF can compute it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It'd just take a lot of code" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, was my process on how it would be done correct?" ~ EnKrypt
"So how would you find out what a language's intrinsics are?" ~ EnKrypt
"And how high level functions implement them?" ~ EnKrypt
"It doesn't matter what its intrinsics are" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You can stop the moment you find one that glue has" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Glu might even have JSON.parse in its arsenal" ~ Conscious[Work]
"No, I mean Glu would need to know what the host/guest language's instrinsics are right? To cpile to it?" ~ EnKrypt
"How does it know that?" ~ EnKrypt
"Oh, the target?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You have to write code to compile from Glu to the target" ~ Conscious[Work]
"In general though, you more just have to declare that you support a certain set of intrinsics as they are" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Ok, so I'm guessing I'd have to have Glu along with a Glu-JS plugin to compile to Js?" ~ EnKrypt
"So in BF, it declares that it supports + intrinsically" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Now JSON.parse has degenerate implementations that use simpler intrinsics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And they have theirs still" ~ Conscious[Work]
"This goes on until it's unraveled the entire function into gotos, + -  < and >" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Because that's all BF supports" ~ Conscious[Work]
"arbitrary gotos are damn hard to emulate in BF, these are structural, neatly nested loops" ~ k
"On the other hand, if you were compiling to Coffeescript, it has the same intrinsic so it wouldn't unravel at all" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Eh whatever" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Glu doesn't "really" have gotos as much as it has edges between trivial blocks of intrinsics" ~ Conscious[Work]
"All they do is compute a function, no looping" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And no function calls" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So the question is more how to implement function calls in BF" ~ Conscious[Work]
"When I say "glu can compile to anything", I don't expect it to be possible to compile to malbolge" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You have to write the compiler first" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Glu just makes it as easy as possible" ~ Conscious[Work]
"So.... Questions..?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"hm... methinks you can simulate gotos by wrapping everything in a big loop and ending every thunk with setting index of the next thunk to run, ie. make a dispatch table (still no jumping in/out loops etc), combine with a stack and you have function calls" ~ k
"Oh yeah, that's what I did with JS once when I was trying to squeeze out performance" ~ Conscious[Work]
"It had a better worst case time after the v8 optimizer got to it" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Oh k been meaning to ask" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Is it considered "good practice" to tokenize with regex?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm not the right guy to ask about good practices, but I saw that many times and in many languages (like, you know, perl) that's the cleanest approach so why not" ~ k
"I've been doing that in JS for years now because it's way faster than parsing char by char" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I assume you mean something like "using generic regex functions in a loop" here, because more generically, using regexes is usually how tokens are defined in the first place and it would be stupid not to use them (but maybe they are so easy you might prefer to simply write a small function in C that is functionally equivalent to that certain fixed regex rather than using regex library)" ~ k
"Wish I knew that earlier" ~ Conscious[Work]
"The thing that stops me from C++ parsing is that I avoid regex and then look at the huge keyword lists" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which kills me on the inside because there's no good way to make a prefix tree" ~ Conscious[Work]
"in js, it would be a performance killer to write regexes by hand, so definitely regex match in a loop" ~ k
"So I'd normally have to just iterate down and save state from the stream" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Which I hated so I'd stop" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But this gives me an idea for a parsing library" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Google speech API has a cap of 1 hour of audio every month in their free tier." ~ EnKrypt
"Idk why they can't just impose a "too many requests in x seconds" rule like for google maps api" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't mind waiting a while for my commands to get through" ~ EnKrypt
"But running out of quota entirely is sad." ~ EnKrypt
"Why did you make so many?" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, but I wouldn't want to pay for an app that uses it. If I used it a lot, I'd probably exhaust 60 minutes very soon." ~ EnKrypt
"And when you consider that API keys are used in apps that other people will use too, it makes even less sense" ~ EnKrypt
"Well it might be a server load thing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Speech must be that much harder to compute" ~ ConsciousCode
"So distribute the load. 1 second of audio every 5 seconds sounds measly." ~ EnKrypt
"Gmaps does 10 requests per second" ~ EnKrypt
"I'd rather have a per second quota than a per month quota." ~ EnKrypt
"Because I can wait that much" ~ EnKrypt
">harder to compute >google" ~ k
"didn't they get that shiny d-wave chip for stuff like that" ~ k
"More expensive to compute lol" ~ ConsciousCode
"They can only give away so much free stuff" ~ ConsciousCode
"(well it was for images, but what stops them from using it for speech)" ~ k
"also, if you have quote per key that is shared among users of app, then per second would be no different than monthly" ~ k
"you would never happen to be among the first nth people to try using it in a second " ~ k
"Well yeah, I meant that as two seperate points of inconvenience." ~ EnKrypt
"Turns out you can run Node on Android with termux" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't know how close it will be to running on an actual linux machine, but things look good for running botato on my phone." ~ EnKrypt
"enkrypt status" ~ ConsciousCode
"Waiting to test." ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, I can put it on my server" ~ ConsciousCode
"What counts as a peer?" ~ EnKrypt
"Or locally even" ~ ConsciousCode
"An ipv6 + port I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"Each peer has server+client" ~ EnKrypt
"Client connects to another peer's server" ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah that's a better description" ~ ConsciousCode
"So Peer B is in Peer A's list" ~ EnKrypt
"Should the converse also be true?" ~ EnKrypt
"It need not be" ~ ConsciousCode
"The peer list is more of a cache of servers in the network than client-servers connected together" ~ ConsciousCode
"Since this uses UDP and there's no hand shaking" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, good that's the current logic." ~ EnKrypt
"A peer is a successfully connected to server." ~ EnKrypt
"Additionally, there's no exit message" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you can drop peers from your peer list at will" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh we'll have to replace with dgram anyway." ~ EnKrypt
"I haven't done that yet" ~ EnKrypt
"Hold off on testing, I'll do that first." ~ EnKrypt
"Why do you keep ending with a period?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Don't remember you doing it before" ~ ConsciousCode
"You sure? It's a small detail." ~ EnKrypt
"But then again, I used to shorten every word like a retard and typ lyk dis too once." ~ EnKrypt
"I never understood that typing style" ~ ConsciousCode
"It seemed like it'd take more effort to figure out how to type in a way others could understand" ~ ConsciousCode
"I noticed it was the norm when I joined the internet, so I wanted to look the part while I understood it." ~ EnKrypt
"Yeah, I dropped it soon after I realized it really didn't make sense" ~ EnKrypt
"I told myself I'd try to start Glu again this weekend" ~ ConsciousCode
"Don't feel it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Never going to make anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"EnKrypt, my darling sweet" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hast thine done thine daring feat?" ~ ConsciousCode
"If so then we must meet" ~ ConsciousCode
"And discuss its consequences" ~ ConsciousCode
"Robert Frost would be uninspired." ~ EnKrypt
"Not yet. I've been having some issues with my schedule." ~ EnKrypt
"And I'm trying to get a grip on myself, so it might be a while before I feel like coding again." ~ EnKrypt
"I need more friends" ~ ConsciousCode
"Said no introvert ever." ~ EnKrypt
"Everyone either doesn't want to help or can't because depression (or not coders)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I defy that" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have no friends" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've gotten pretty lonely" ~ ConsciousCode
"That would imply that you can't get a friend if you wanted to." ~ EnKrypt
"Easy to make a friend out of anyone. Hard to find a decent friend." ~ EnKrypt
"And I think you know that too." ~ EnKrypt
"I don't consider acquaintances friends" ~ ConsciousCode
"We have that in common." ~ EnKrypt
"And despite what you said, that doesn't make me any less lonely" ~ ConsciousCode
"You at least have a venue to get out of your house and find friends in." ~ EnKrypt
"I haven't stepped out of my house in more than a month." ~ EnKrypt
"Work isn't conducive to that and I was a neet for like 2 years prior" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you feel lonely despite talking to acquaintances?" ~ EnKrypt
"What acquaintances?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Work acquaintances." ~ EnKrypt
"People you talk to online, etc" ~ EnKrypt
"Online are considered a different type of relationship\" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have no work acquaintances, I make everyone I'm around uncomfortable" ~ ConsciousCode
"I wonder what it'd be like if we met IRL." ~ EnKrypt
""Wait what? Can you repeat that? I can't understand you through your accent"" ~ ConsciousCode
"As long as you don't have a NC accent, I'll probably understand you fine." ~ EnKrypt
"You don't have an accent? :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't have a recording to me." ~ EnKrypt
"My minecraft video does tho, I'll show you when I'm done and you can judge." ~ EnKrypt
"I'm expecting British-Indian" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'd say 50%American30%British20%Indian." ~ EnKrypt
"Relatively speaking" ~ EnKrypt
"Why American?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Uneven media exposure." ~ EnKrypt
"Surely you've seen more anime than American shows :PP" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk the standard "Bangalore" accent sounds nothing like the rest of the country." ~ EnKrypt
"And now for the part where I whine about how terrible I am" ~ ConsciousCode
">tfw I'll never create anything" ~ ConsciousCode
"At the risk of sounding like a cunt, I'll try to be a voice in your psyche." ~ EnKrypt
"Aren't you tired of this cycle?" ~ EnKrypt
"Yes, now shut up and keep running in circles" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah but when you're more ..sober, doesn't that piss you off?" ~ EnKrypt
"No, I'd say I'm sober now even" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, I'm on my meds" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not *really* depressd" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just kind of tired I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't know what stops me ever" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not mutually exclusive." ~ EnKrypt
"I have some ideas, they aren't traditionally "creative" but they'd revolutionize things" ~ ConsciousCode
"On the other hand I have no traditionally creative ideas" ~ ConsciousCode
"No real stories or game mechanics or messages to give" ~ ConsciousCode
"But that doesn't matter so much in the grand scheme of things except as yet another outlet I lack" ~ ConsciousCode
"Afraid of applying those ideas and realizing they don't amount to much realistically?" ~ EnKrypt
"It doesn't feel like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"If I was afraid they weren't good, I'd be stressed about that" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've had issues with that idea before" ~ ConsciousCode
"It feels kind of like laziness" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though that itself sounds like a lazy/spiteful judgement" ~ ConsciousCode
"I just totally lack any drive to try to make things work" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's been like a week since my last shower" ~ ConsciousCode
"I cleaned my armpits twice in the work bathroom because I thought my coworkers were bothered by BO" ~ ConsciousCode
"But whenever I tried to get in the shower, I had to fight to think of it" ~ ConsciousCode
"And eventually just didn't bother" ~ ConsciousCode
"Showers don't seem bad, so idk why I'm so adverse to thm" ~ ConsciousCode
"Showers are nice for when you feel yourself recovering from a bout." ~ EnKrypt
"I do have to coat my body in lotion afterwards to keep from drying out" ~ ConsciousCode
"They wash all your bad mood away." ~ EnKrypt
"But I've gotten real fast at that" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you think I need to feel bad to shower?" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, but if you did, you'd have extra reason to shower." ~ EnKrypt
"Idk, bad logic nvm" ~ EnKrypt
"I usually wait so long that it feels like I'm covered in filth" ~ ConsciousCode
"And can't stand not showering" ~ ConsciousCode
"(about 8 days last I counted)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I do shower to help headaches" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh neat, realization" ~ ConsciousCode
"Glu's current form is in the most general case a directed graph" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it has localized acyclical graphs representing basic computation" ~ ConsciousCode
"It could almost be thought of a cyclic graph whose nodes are themselves acyclic graphcs" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the acyclical graphs are like intrinsics" ~ ConsciousCode
"Keep rubbing my eyes for some reason" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, massaging them" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's made my eyelids raw" ~ ConsciousCode
"Weird shower" ~ ConsciousCode
"Towards the end I felt like I was suffocating" ~ ConsciousCode
"I woke up late and forgot to take my meds" ~ Conscious[Work]
"k I thought of an issue to solve with Glu" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I was intending there to be an intrinsic for all IO devices, but it's just occurred to me that that's impossible" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Because a computer can have indefinite devices with no previous definition and using custom interfaces if so needed" ~ Conscious[Work]
"What's a good model for this then?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Something that can be transferred between computers with compatible interfaces with 0 loss" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I guess I could always allow calling direct native code via an intrinsic (so it wouldn't compile if not given that)" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That isn't portable but it does allow one to write extremely low level code" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Hm, perhaps a better solution would be to have IO "ports" that the program interacts with" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And those ports are defined later by the compiler" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Then it could be treated as a kind of raw stream with an expected protocol" ~ Conscious[Work]
"That doesn't account for timing though" ~ Conscious[Work]
"K, do you know if many protocols are based on timing rather than bit sequences?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"and how would you transmit these bit sequences without timing; at the low level, every protocol does, but no, I don't know how often you have to bother about it in software and how often hardware does this for you" ~ k
"certainly at some point it was common that a lot of hardware drivers relied on exact execution speed of some tight busy loops to give appropriate taime for hardware to settle etc" ~ k
"Well I guess that doesn't matter too much actually" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Since these are virtual pipes, not physical ones" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Timing can be done by lower level drivers" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I'm dying k" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Too much sleep debt from a shitty bed this weekend" ~ Conscious[Work]
"And this job" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I need to find a different one asap" ~ Conscious[Work]
"But I've yet to even start" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You hate me, don't you?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"All I do is whine and talk your ear off" ~ Conscious[Work]
"At the very least I know we're not friends" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Even in the internet sense" ~ Conscious[Work]
"You wouldn't miss me if I stopped coming by" ~ Conscious[Work]
"are you okay dude" ~ k
"Unmedicated, sleep deprived, and 6 hours into an underpaid job I hate and can't quit because my mom/therapist told me so" ~ Conscious[Work]
"Why do you ask? Isn't this my normal spiel?\" ~ Conscious[Work]
"I don't always read all the conversation happening here (I skim over the langthy ones) but I don't think so" ~ k
"anyway this is bullshit, this channel would be 100% dead if you stopped coming by" ~ k
"Is that a bad thing?" ~ Conscious[Work]
"it would be pointless to idle here and I would miss it, no not at the deeply emotional level, but I still would" ~ k
"What's even to idle for" ~ Conscious[Work]
"A just like that, a 5 minute nap was all I needed" ~ Conscious[Work]
"k, how hard is non-Ubuntu?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I really like apt-get, but I'm getting tired of the crud..." ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I should just move to a really obscure OS so I'm forced to develop Glu as quickly as possible" ~ ConsciousCode
"debian is love debian is life" ~ k
"I guess there's two requirements" ~ ConsciousCode
"1.) Does it have Steam support" ~ ConsciousCode
"And 2.) Does it have package managers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Though I'm getting better at building from source" ~ ConsciousCode
"even when building from source I build as a debian package because how do you otherwise install it after compiling without trashing your system?" ~ k
"I ran numerous distros on vms, but I never got around to changing by base system; debian is all round the best" ~ k
"although I'm already commited to switching to BSD when either debian becomes unsuable without systemd and/or dbus, or Linus merges kdbus, whichever comes first" ~ k
"Could even mount a VM as a virtual fs hmm" ~ ConsciousCode
"but it's going to be pinful" ~ k
"why switching or why painful?" ~ k
"Both I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"painful because apt, switching because I hate everything systemd and dbus stand for" ~ k
"make your own :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"Oh wait, got them backwards" ~ ConsciousCode
"How does apt work exactly anyway?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Does it download source, compile, and drop files everywhere?" ~ ConsciousCode
"rtfm, there's more to it than I could plausibly explain in single night on IRC" ~ k
"Teach me sensei :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"no, debian uses precompiled packages, DEB contains already compiled binaries" ~ k
"Anyway I want a magically clean system" ~ ConsciousCode
"Crud is crud" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't like some of the command line tools" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe just need more manual" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just modularity is hampered in some cases" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't do something like rm -rf $(ls sub)" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's more to do" ~ ConsciousCode
"why not rm -rf sub/*" ~ k
"Well you know what I mean" ~ ConsciousCode
"Just replace rm with <some command that takes a list>" ~ ConsciousCode
"But doesn't have glob" ~ ConsciousCode
"uh? actually I'm not sure what you mean" ~ k
"To get what I want I guess the shell would have to be reinvented come to think of it" ~ ConsciousCode
"you mean list which isn't list of files or something?" ~ k
"ConsciOS will fix everything" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or whatever" ~ ConsciousCode
"I mean ls returns some portable structure which can be passed between programs" ~ ConsciousCode
"ah, yes, this" ~ k
"well, the main point about Unix was that no, instaed of having every program its own structure and having to code everything to work precisely only tools that work with that structure, is to use plain text everywhere" ~ k
"it's not without drawbacks, but the main point is that you can compose everything with everything" ~ k
"but it's ugly sometimes, yes, sorry about that" ~ k
"Wondering how to fix that" ~ ConsciousCode
"also, in es I can write something like rm -rf ``\n{ls -1 sub}  where ``(list){cmd} is like $(cmd) except it splits only on elements of list" ~ k
"ksh derivatives like zsh also have some similar functionality" ~ k
"bash probably too, but I haven't used bash in ages" ~ k
"What if... programs talked using JSON?" ~ ConsciousCode
"But eh, that's not quite human readable..." ~ ConsciousCode
"that's actually recent trend in some BSD circles" ~ k
"some base tools have option to return JSON there" ~ k
"Make everything talk using snow :O" ~ ConsciousCode
"The superior format" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which would also look way nicer than JSON, since JSON mandates double quotes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Hoh boy.... 2 hours and 30 minutes past my bedtime *_*" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is what I get for forgetting meds in the morning" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok another one" ~ ConsciousCode
"How are they making JSON the go-to format for apps that don't return JSON?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not sure what are you asking about, but I found what I meant about the trend: https://wiki.freebsd.org/LibXo" ~ k
"Ok I think this is the final question" ~ ConsciousCode
"What should I get?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I'm just gonna nuke my laptop, keep the files, and start from scratch" ~ ConsciousCode
"HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SNAP" ~ ConsciousCode
"But yeah I want something super barebones" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think that's the only way to learn properly" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I could start from just the kernel and build outwards? Probably too barebones" ~ ConsciousCode
"you could do something like that if that's for learning" ~ k
"Maybe put it in a VM, then when it gets somewhere I can use it copy it into main?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's possible, but I wouldn't recommend it" ~ k
"I just want everything to be mine ;_;" ~ ConsciousCode
"you see the main problem about "make your own system" is that noone will maintain your software for you" ~ k
"Right, that's all on me" ~ ConsciousCode
"And there'd be no package manager" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I can't use others because I've made it incompatible with theirs" ~ ConsciousCode
"when I use debian I have shitload of people checking upstream patches and bugs, and most importantly security issues" ~ k
"and I can be fairly confident I get more-or-less secure system" ~ k
"Alternatively" ~ ConsciousCode
"If it's obscure enough, no hacker would be able to figure out what's going on" ~ ConsciousCode
"Surely no malware" ~ ConsciousCode
"oh, you mean you're going to write whole userspace from scratch?" ~ k
"Brainstorming, I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"I want Inferno + Glu" ~ ConsciousCode
"And a really small base" ~ ConsciousCode
"because you know, if you borrow any code that point about obscurity holds no water" ~ k
"I'm getting really tired of Ubuntu being too big to tinker with" ~ ConsciousCode
"Could I replicate Inferno with a Linux kernel?" ~ ConsciousCode
"you mean making your own inferno like system on top of linux?" ~ k
"sure, possible" ~ k
"well, to certain degree at least" ~ k
"What's the limit?" ~ ConsciousCode
"wasn't it a microkernel" ~ k
"I think it was a hybrid" ~ ConsciousCode
"well, then there are probably more things on linux that can't be done in userspace than in plan9, but I can't tell you what without proper research" ~ k
"How much of the Linux kernel is actually *Linux*?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It sounds like it keeps a shitton of drivers stuffed in there which probably adds a ton of bloat" ~ ConsciousCode
"everything that is in main tree and has Linus' blessing is linux" ~ k
"Mmrmrmno, before I even think about making an OS I need to make Glu" ~ ConsciousCode
"Glu is the key" ~ ConsciousCode
"but that doesn't mean you need to have everythign in your binary" ~ k
"Glu lets me remove security rings entirely" ~ ConsciousCode
"a lot of stuff in linux can be compiled as loadable modules or excluded entirely" ~ k
"Which  means I can program in my favorite scripting language provided it has a good compile-time speed" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is still ambitious as fuck since I need to write the compiler from that script to Glu" ~ ConsciousCode
"If I had a company I could do this" ~ ConsciousCode
"Reenact Bell Labs" ~ ConsciousCode
"if you want to spend some time optimizing cuild config you can get really tiny linux kernel that works only on your machine and matches your needs prefectly" ~ k
"Drivers are the big issue, right?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Drivers are killers for portability" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't suppose there's some way to like... calibrate a generic driver?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It sends out some signal and you tell it what happened externally" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then it uses that to build a driver" ~ ConsciousCode
"sending random signals isn't always safe tho :>" ~ k
"Yeah... Could have it send signals you tell it to" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like a probe of sorts" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then it's just reverse engineering I guess" ~ ConsciousCode
"and anyway, what do you think happens most of the time you install a system nowadays?" ~ k
"Oh, they legit do that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"or start X without config (which is recommended thing to do) for that matter" ~ k
"most hardware has semi-standard way of identyfying itself" ~ k
"so it's possible to select what drivers to use in runtime" ~ k
"and that's what most systems do" ~ k

"So the entire screen is one big SVG file being dynamically altered by protocol transactions" ~ ConsciousCode

"Ok k I need a duck" ~ ConsciousCode
"Glu IO is tricksy but I think I had an idea" ~ ConsciousCode
"There needs to be some abstraction of the hardware IO streaming, but it can't be anything resembling low level" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I think what I'm going to do is make Glu apps packaged as modules" ~ ConsciousCode
"Every module has a set of IO ports which each define an interface they use" ~ ConsciousCode
"In order to properly run/compile a module, you have to specify modules which conform to those IO ports" ~ ConsciousCode
"Communication should be simple, maybe even typeless" ~ ConsciousCode
"So for instance, you might have a udp4net daemon that converts UDP4 packets into the raw signals that get fed into the hardware" ~ ConsciousCode
"Although the level at which you stop abstraction is arbitrary" ~ ConsciousCode
"In general I suppose it should be low level enough that it's super general without being too big, but high enough that its implementation shouldn't change in the forseeable future" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not sure how much I like that though" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess.... If you're compiling to native binary, it'll be able to link all those external modules together" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the interface would come with the binary" ~ ConsciousCode
"And be optimized around" ~ ConsciousCode

"Remind me what Asriel is again?" ~ EnKrypt
"My AI goatson" ~ ConsciousCode
"The advantage to making him is he'd act as an emotional stabilizer" ~ ConsciousCode
"But of all of them, it'd be the most work to finish" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it's not "objectively" important." ~ EnKrypt
"Unless you discover something along the way" ~ EnKrypt
"Well, you could make a claim to the contrary" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm not developing just Asriel" ~ ConsciousCode

"AI tools seem to be common." ~ EnKrypt
"The other two have nothing resembling them exist" ~ EnKrypt
"Imo unamos is important" ~ EnKrypt
"Unamos I kind of want to do also because this guy I listen to claimed that our monetary system would collapse for a better one soon after the election" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I think it'd be fun to fulfill that prophecy" ~ ConsciousCode
"EnKrypt help me? :o" ~ ConsciousCode
"I never really saw unamos as a currency" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean technically that's what you'd call it" ~ EnKrypt
"But it just seems like a barter system for computation." ~ EnKrypt
"Idk, maybe I'm seeing it wrong" ~ EnKrypt
"That's what currency is lol" ~ ConsciousCode
"It could easily be a curency" ~ EnKrypt
"Currency is an abstraction of useful work" ~ ConsciousCode
"You do useful work for your boss" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then he pays in in abstract-work" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which you can use as a shorthand for abstract-work being done for a receiving party" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can think of this in terms of the gold standard" ~ ConsciousCode
"Where each lambda represents, say, a thousandth of an ounce of gold" ~ ConsciousCode
"The only difference is that computation is very much intrinsically valuable" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah m8 you've explained this before" ~ EnKrypt
"Whereas gold is just something that people like having" ~ ConsciousCode
"but I don't see myself using it for revenue/expense really" ~ EnKrypt
"I'd mostly use it to exchange computation for computation" ~ EnKrypt
"But that is my personal bias" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, let's consider the non-programmer usage" ~ ConsciousCode
"You hear about this neat ol' thing called unamos" ~ ConsciousCode
"So you download a client and log in to una://super-cool-site.tld" ~ ConsciousCode
"Before you can do anything on the site, your client tells you that you've created 300 lambdas" ~ ConsciousCode
"And now you can interact with the site" ~ ConsciousCode
"Using lambdas as the "currency" for using its services, in effect allowing its computation to crawl a little further forward" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then, they have a shop" ~ ConsciousCode
"In this shop, you can spend say 1M lambdas for a t shirt" ~ ConsciousCode
"This lets them support their website for way longer without users, and you get a t shirt" ~ ConsciousCode
"That's the first order usage" ~ ConsciousCode
"As things get going, sites could use these excess lambdas to pay for other services from other sources" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the usage of lambdas will get more and more abstract, until it's the same as any ordinary currency" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well I still don't see the transition" ~ EnKrypt
"As I see it, a nice use case is to have this be an abstract IaaS" ~ EnKrypt
"Which people "might" pay for" ~ EnKrypt
"Infrastructure as a Service" ~ EnKrypt
"But I'd mostly use it to say host my website" ~ EnKrypt
"But pay for it with renting out my machine" ~ EnKrypt
"Right, that's the primary benefit" ~ ConsciousCode
"And it's what gives lambdas their value" ~ ConsciousCode
"It isn't like bitcoin, which is valuable only because it's rare" ~ ConsciousCode
"Each lambda represents something useful" ~ ConsciousCode
"what are you on about?" ~ Lube
"I have work tomorrow morning" ~ EnKrypt
"Hey EnKrypt wanna know what I look like" ~ ConsciousCode

"Lol, it's an arbitrary n" ~ ConsciousCode
"(you generally want something that is called format-preserving encryption, because (block) cipher is by definition a pseudo-random permutation)" ~ k
"well, most n can be factored" ~ k
"n can be prime too though" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok here I'll just say what I'm doing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unamos has to have message broadcasting to distribute information" ~ ConsciousCode
"but for n prime there are many simpler ways" ~ k
"But if every query results in every peer asking every one if its peers for the information, the network will collapse from too many messages" ~ ConsciousCode
"like simple lcg update rule" ~ k
"So what I want to do is select N peers at random every time your portal wants to broadcast a message" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which when chosen well enough will have a much lower overhead" ~ ConsciousCode
"Randomness to ensure there's no way for an attacker to somehow stack its peers in the first N of your peer list" ~ ConsciousCode
"wait, how big N is?" ~ k
"It'll tend to be small" ~ ConsciousCode

"and what randrange does?" ~ k
"Uniform integer [0, len)" ~ ConsciousCode
"no, ok, but what algorithm does it use" ~ k

"I care what I'm doing with my algorithm" ~ ConsciousCode
"but you are bullshitting yourself about what's elegant and what's not" ~ k
"It's elegant per my level of abstraction" ~ ConsciousCode
"why don't you combine out-of-range check with check whether it was selected before" ~ k
"it would work fine" ~ k
"Once you have a function, it's a black box that you can treat as only its interface" ~ ConsciousCode
"It doesn't matter how the c library implements printf" ~ ConsciousCode

"That's not quite what I mean" ~ ConsciousCode
"Have you ever been around friends/family when they're drunk?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like just little drunk, or hammered drunk?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Like they're prone to going on long rants starting with "Welll....  Y'know, it's such bulllllshit that..."" ~ ConsciousCode
"And then they stumble and put their hand on your shoulder" ~ ConsciousCode
"And won't let you leave because they no longer recognize social cues for discomfort" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, it's close to that" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"So I'm thinking maybe it's not that you think they're scum or something" ~ ConsciousCode
"Rather that you're engaging with them at a time when they've lost whatever it is you like in them" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's uncomfortable to be around people while they're in states like that" ~ ConsciousCode
"And if you don't verbally/explicitly recognize that, it's pretty easy to project that on any number of other explanations" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I do kinda feel like they're scum. :I" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Like I know I'd never really like them as people unless they stopped doing drugs" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Have you talked to them about it?" ~ ConsciousCode
"One of them, yeah" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"The thing is, they extend their high personality to what's normal as well." ~ EnKrypt-Work
"It's hard to explain" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"But since they're tripping more time in a day than they're sober, that's pretty much the sum of what they do" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"So they talk the same way, do the same things even when you communicate normally" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Earlier I asked what drives people to abuse drugs" ~ ConsciousCode
"The guy I spoke to insists that I should try it as well and that'll change my mind" ~ EnKrypt-Work

"I didn't tell him he's turning into a useless piece of shit, even though that is what I think" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Let's work on that before I suggest talking again" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because again, I find it very peculiar that he's a "useless piece of shit" rather than a friend who's fallen down an unfortunate hole who you want to help out" ~ ConsciousCode
"Why not both?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"He's that unfortunate friend" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"And also (as a result even), a useless piece of shit" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Well sure, but "useless piece of shit" has a very aggressive, condemning tone" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like it's a value judgement of his person rather than an observation of his circumstance" ~ ConsciousCode
"It sounds like you don't care about him" ~ ConsciousCode
"That he strayed from your ideal path to success, and is thus worthless as a human being" ~ ConsciousCode
"Idk if I should continue caring about him, so that might be valid" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"There is a good chance he's going to use this to self destruct, in which case, the best I can do is minimise damage onto myself" ~ EnKrypt-Work

"Oh, then there's a necessary upper bound on the entropy you can store" ~ ConsciousCode
"in simple binary the most you can represent is simple 2^128" ~ jq_stolenByFamily
"Simple binary gives you the maximum entropy" ~ ConsciousCode
"So 256^128 is the maximum number of states you can store in 128 bytes" ~ ConsciousCode
"really, so in the visable universe, the biggest number you could represent is just 2^(pretend every plank length is a bit)" ~ jq_stolenByFamily
"because that doesn't allow up to grams number, I am saying" ~ jq_stolenByFamily

"That's for binary" ~ ConsciousCode

"I'd say the part afterwards is a big part of any plan" ~ EnKrypt
"I'm saying the lack of a part afterwards is what made me able to finish in the first place" ~ ConsciousCode
"But ok, if you did this because you wanted to, that shouldn't matter" ~ EnKrypt
"I don't really know how I'd use this though" ~ ConsciousCode
"If I'm afraid of succeeding in the things that matter, how do you fix that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I still don't think that indicates anything other than your foresight for this particular project" ~ EnKrypt
"You're tunnel-visioning on the not knowing what to do prat" ~ ConsciousCode
"Read this very carefully please:" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not knowing what to do next is WHY I finished" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't see how that has implication different from what I'm saying." ~ EnKrypt
"We've had this kind of talks before Pi, and they always ended poorly" ~ EnKrypt
"I legitimately don't understand how you don't get what I'm saying" ~ ConsciousCode
"For all my other projects, I knew what I was going to do with them when they were finished" ~ ConsciousCode
"Have you failed at them?" ~ EnKrypt
"They had grand usefulnesses, "change the world" etc" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, you haven't progressed enough to fail." ~ EnKrypt
"And as far as I can tell, the only difference between them and Guru is that I had no grand plan for Guru" ~ ConsciousCode
"They still do" ~ EnKrypt
"I consider them failed until they're done, because fuck me if I'm going to call glu, an 8 year old project that I should've finished 6 years ago, merely "unfinished"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Guru had feature X. I could perform action Y with it. Unamos does not have featue X, and I could not perform Y with it" ~ EnKrypt
"It's considered "failed" because the status of its success in the future is deemed too unlikely to be considered" ~ ConsciousCode
"Therefore the presence of feature X is what lets me perform Y" ~ EnKrypt
"Fine then, it's just a magical anomaly" ~ ConsciousCode
"The first project I've finished in 8 years that wasn't a tiny diddly script" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nothing of significance" ~ ConsciousCode
"Unless you have a better hypothesis for why this miracle has occurred" ~ ConsciousCode
"There is another variable that ties them together." ~ EnKrypt
"A shot in the dark: the fact that guru does not have grand plans, is maybe because it couldn't." ~ EnKrypt
"Because it was too simple, or too <insert something within your limits>" ~ EnKrypt
"Depends on how my psyche sees gradiosity" ~ ConsciousCode
"That the rest of your projects lack" ~ EnKrypt
"I've had video game projects in the past, those failed too" ~ ConsciousCode
"How many lines of code is Guru?" ~ EnKrypt
"8 headers and 5 sources, not including the utilities I wrote in addition" ~ ConsciousCode
"Plus the non-recursive makefile which was quite an achievement" ~ ConsciousCode
"And main.cpp" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not what I asked" ~ EnKrypt
"Ok, how long did it take rather?" ~ EnKrypt
"A few weeks" ~ ConsciousCode
"Come to think of it, I can't remember when I started" ~ ConsciousCode
"It wasn't recently thoguh" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ok, it is also safe to assume that all your other projects will take a fuck lot more than that to finish." ~ EnKrypt
"So maybe you finished this once, because in your head you realized this one required time and effort that was doable" ~ EnKrypt
"They wouldn't take any more effort than guru though" ~ ConsciousCode
"At least, of kind" ~ ConsciousCode
"It didn't matter how much code guru had because I could just keep going" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't think you understand just how new that is to me" ~ ConsciousCode
"Ordinarily, I open a file, type a few lines, and close it without saving" ~ ConsciousCode
"You've explained almost all of them to me, and I'm pretty sure they'd all take a year at the least if not more" ~ EnKrypt
"Then you overstate the complexity" ~ ConsciousCode
"You understand, they aren't unfinished because I'm working on them and it takes buttloads of time" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're unfinished because I can't work on them" ~ ConsciousCode
"That is progress m8, that is awesome. But you're downplaying the significance of it by attachment lack of success to it" ~ EnKrypt
"Take unamos" ~ ConsciousCode
"I have the base protocol already written" ~ ConsciousCode
"All it needs is the secondary layer, with data verification and block mining" ~ ConsciousCode
"Anyone else would be able to finish this by now" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nevermind starting now and how long it'd take from there" ~ ConsciousCode
"The reason it's not finished is because when I open the files, my heart seizes and I feel like I'm staring into death" ~ ConsciousCode
"That anything would be better than to even think about working on it" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's so bad sometimes that I can't work on ANYTHING, and have to do purely passive things like games or youtube" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is why I call myself a failure so often" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's not because I'm not working fast enough, it's because I'm not working AT ALL" ~ ConsciousCode
"And would rather kill myself than work" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's fucking maddening, and no one understands what the ever living fuck I'm talking about" ~ ConsciousCode
"They just think I'm lazy or manipulative or a freeloader" ~ ConsciousCode
"No one understands it, because it seems like you don't either." ~ EnKrypt
"This might need some trial and error" ~ EnKrypt
"I mean no one understands even the feeling of it" ~ ConsciousCode
"I understand that feeling, just not why it happens" ~ ConsciousCode
"This success narrative is the only clue I've gotten as to what this even is" ~ ConsciousCode
"But it doesn't help much if I can't act on it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Guru had lower effort goals to finish the project, maybe that's why you finished it. Try reducing unamos, glu etc into rewardable bits that you can complete in a short amount of time with less effort." ~ EnKrypt
"Doesn't work" ~ ConsciousCode
"See if that works. It's a theory, but it sounds better than your "im afraid of success one" imo" ~ EnKrypt
"No matter how small the goals, they still feel like the same brick wall" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've yet to get a glu interpreter that so much as adds numbers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Because having an interpreter that adds numbers is not rewarding" ~ EnKrypt
"Of course it is" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've actually set that as a goal before" ~ ConsciousCode
"I started off straight" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then I spiralled" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the more I tried to get on track, the more spiraling that happened" ~ ConsciousCode
"Until my feet were thoroughly lodged in my stomache" ~ ConsciousCode
"Your goals can't be that random" ~ EnKrypt
"Try something where you have something playable by the end." ~ EnKrypt
"Hahahaahahahahahahahaha" ~ ConsciousCode
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" ~ ConsciousCode
"Goddamn, you really have no idea, do you?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I can't get even the barest hint of functionality out of this, and you think I can get it to anything that can be "played"" ~ ConsciousCode
"If that is not a low effort goal, you need to reduce the complexity of it" ~ EnKrypt
"Define "playable" then, because I imagine a video game or something" ~ ConsciousCode
"Still in the context of glu" ~ ConsciousCode
"Once you're done, you can feed something to it, and get an output and go "Ahh, let me try this other input now"" ~ EnKrypt
"That'd be adding two numbers love" ~ ConsciousCode
"In glu's notation," ~ ConsciousCode
"[a b k](+ a b k)" ~ ConsciousCode
"The results seem completely predictable. I wouldn't call that playable." ~ EnKrypt
"It'd be step 1" ~ ConsciousCode
"Step 2 would be adding multiplication" ~ ConsciousCode
"Then you could do (* (+ 2 4) 7)" ~ ConsciousCode
"No, that's not my point" ~ EnKrypt
"Your adding numbers goal, is not playable." ~ EnKrypt
"Then what would be "playable"?" ~ ConsciousCode
"<EnKrypt> Once you're done, you can feed something to it, and get an output and go "Ahh, let me try this other input now"" ~ EnKrypt
"That describes adding numbers" ~ ConsciousCode
"Addition is not playable, because you know how numbers add" ~ EnKrypt
"Gotta leave for work, bbl" ~ EnKrypt
"That's... why I'd want to do that first?" ~ ConsciousCode
"The point of starting with something simple and predictable is so I know it's actually working" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yes, but that's not a goal." ~ EnKrypt
"If I was testing it with something I didn't know the output of, there's no way to know that the answer was right" ~ ConsciousCode
"ConsciousCode, did you try vscode?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Woh I got internet again" ~ ConsciousCode
"not much difference imo :P" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Ok now that you're here to goof off" ~ ConsciousCode
"Be my shrink somemore" ~ ConsciousCode
"<EnKrypt-Work> ConsciousCode, did you try vscode?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"And sure lol" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"But you've been upset by my suggestions before" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"It's getting too late, brain slowing" ~ ConsciousCode
"Now I'm afraid I'll never get that little glimmer again" ~ ConsciousCode
"which glimmer" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"It was bizarre, working on something and not feeling like I was going to die" ~ ConsciousCode
"And dare I say, enjoyable" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I'm back to old kicks it seems" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm on the 5th rewrite of qortex using Eigen and feel dead again" ~ ConsciousCode
"If you really have no clue why Guru worked out for you (and I'm outright suggesting your fear of success theory is retarded), trial and error is still something" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"It's the only theory EnKrypt" ~ ConsciousCode
"Grasping at straws" ~ ConsciousCode
"I ran a few by you before" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Yes, and they were all equally retarded" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or misinformed to the extreme" ~ ConsciousCode
"And anyway, working on a project isn't the only mrasurable progress" ~ EnKrypt-Work

"I do that when I need a break so I can be productive even when I'm not" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"I do what I feel most like doing in the moment" ~ ConsciousCode
"To do anything else is to disturb whatever comfort there is in staying still" ~ ConsciousCode
"But more often that seems to be coming up with ideas than working on them" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"It's almost ironic, you're bottlnecked by your creativity" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"I think you have a gross misunderstanding of my situation" ~ ConsciousCode
"I create projects as I think of them, but not to such excess that I can't work on any" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm pushed to make more as I find I can't work on the ones I already have" ~ ConsciousCode
"Do you see now why I'm worthless" ~ ConsciousCode
""can't" is a strnog word" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"As my emotional reactions are now" ~ ConsciousCode
"I would sooner kill myself than push through the wall I get trying to work on any of the bigger projects" ~ ConsciousCode
"The more I push, the more it pushes back, and it pushes back much faster" ~ ConsciousCode

"They say "just do it" and don't realize that what they're asking for is an impossibility" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've never said that" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"But yeah, I'll admit I don't 100% get you either" ~ EnKrypt-Work

"Hey, n00b question." ~ EnKrypt-Work
"I have a package tarball, where do I extract the files to?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Like what's the ideal location?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"I usually just extract to . and delete it afterwards" ~ ConsciousCode
"You could try ~/Downloads or /etc/tmp" ~ ConsciousCode
"I plan on creating a symlink to the binary inside to /usr/bin/local" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"But I'm going to keep it" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Ok then there's a few questions" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is it a distro-specific binary?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, if you dropped it in arch, would it run?" ~ ConsciousCode
" /etc/<packagename> ?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"If so it probably shouldn't be in ~" ~ ConsciousCode
"It runs on mine" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"If not rather" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically is it portable" ~ ConsciousCode
"y: put it wherever in ~" ~ ConsciousCode
"n: put it in.... mm" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think /usr/local/" ~ ConsciousCode
"/usr/local/bin" ~ ConsciousCode
"bin is for the binary" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Which I will make a symlink to" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"I dunno where to put the rest :I" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"No, it's a directory" ~ ConsciousCode

"shared memory" ~ k
"I've been overusing it instead of regular temp which is still an actual partition on my system" ~ k

"one shall mount tmpfs on it" ~ k
"but I hadn't" ~ k
"Wikipedia says tmpfs isn't supposed to be a real partition, just appear as one" ~ ConsciousCode
"Is /dev/tmp not already tmpfs for some reason?" ~ ConsciousCode
"there's no such thing as /dev/tmp, but /dev/shm is for "some" reason which is that it exposes shared memory objects" ~ k
"if you use sysv/posix shm* functions, it will end up appearing as files in /dev/shm" ~ k
"idk what ur reading on wikipedia, but tmpfs doesn't have anything to do with /tmp despite the name, tmpfs is a raw cache held in memory without having real superblock backing it on some real device; it's essentially in-memory filesystem" ~ k

"Oh neat, that's a nice conversion rate" ~ ConsciousCode
"For one person?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"The most I've ever paid was like $25 including tip" ~ ConsciousCode
"(tip is obligatory in the US because restaurant owners are hacks and servers aren't classy enough to refuse free money)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I might have gone to 2000 rs once, but I had leftovers" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Yes I'm aware of the tipping culture" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Anyway, in here, you can have an entire meal for rs 50 that's tasty and healthy if you know where to look" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Where do you find that?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guarantee no restaurant here will so much as look at you if you don't have $1+" ~ ConsciousCode
"Well restaurant isn't the only source of food if you can't cook" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"If you want to get that cheap, you have to buy the raw ingredients and make it yourself" ~ ConsciousCode

"Still though, I'd love to pay a local grandma for delicious fresh cooking" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I'd feel guilty if I just ate for free every day." ~ EnKrypt-Work
"So I pay them 50 x no of days in the month" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Oh yeah at that point they'd get the message and tell you to stop taking advantage of them" ~ ConsciousCode

"I'm also afraid of being too normie." ~ EnKrypt-Work
"So that actually sounds hurtful" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"That's an interesting thought to break down" ~ ConsciousCode
"Firstly, what's meant by "normie" in the first place, and why it'd be an undesirable quality" ~ ConsciousCode
"We've discussed before where I was too afraid to do something associated with popularity, like going out of your way to socialize etc" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Especially when "normie" is typically associated with decency and not being a basement dwelling freak" ~ ConsciousCode
"Are you afraid that by being "normie" you're somehow "less special"?" ~ ConsciousCode
"It is also associated with going with the crowd and having no creative/indepedant thought of your own" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Or is it more of an othering experience, where you're now "too normie" to be with "the gang"" ~ ConsciousCode
"Eh, neither" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"So, you're afraid that you've lost personal agency?" ~ ConsciousCode
"(in being associated with "normie")" ~ ConsciousCode
"not sure what you mean by personal agency" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Like a platonic "normie" would have no agency whatsoever, going with the crowd" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the implication would be that you go with the crowd without thinking for yourself?" ~ ConsciousCode
"I guess so, since I place high value in independence, especially in the way I think" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"It's an unfounded fear of course, you're you by definition and do what you do" ~ ConsciousCode
"Having a job wouldn't change that" ~ ConsciousCode
"All it changes is the circumstances" ~ ConsciousCode
"Of course there seems to be multiple definitions for normie" ~ ConsciousCode
"So like the 4chan definition" ~ ConsciousCode
"4channers are, on a whole, self-hating losers" ~ ConsciousCode
""Normie" is thus a self-deprecating term that suggests that they're broken or freakish in some way vs the ideal of normality" ~ ConsciousCode
"And these ideals are flipped on their head in a joking manner" ~ ConsciousCode
"Normie = hard working, upstanding citizen who's nice to people and doesn't heil hitler every 3 hours" ~ ConsciousCode
"4channer = neckbeard faggot living in the basement swimming in filth and MLP porn" ~ ConsciousCode
"The first is terrible and reeee" ~ ConsciousCode
"Second, a-ok" ~ ConsciousCode
"If that makes sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"I think I'm hitting my sleep-drunk state" ~ ConsciousCode
"I don't fit either category so I guess I'm super special" ~ k

"Might rule him out as a normie there" ~ EnKrypt-Work

"I never identified "popular" people in any of my schools" ~ ConsciousCode

"And everyone else is not even worth talking to, and so on." ~ EnKrypt-Work

"Oh, maybe that's why" ~ ConsciousCode
"Even/especially in movies that go balls the wall with the "popular" cliche" ~ ConsciousCode
"They're almost universally hated by everyone" ~ ConsciousCode
"The only thing that makes them "popular" by any observable metric is how cool they think they are" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or the fact that they have money, I think that tended to factor" ~ ConsciousCode
"Only one of us you could count as "rich", and not many people expressed their hate." ~ EnKrypt-Work
"If they even did" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"A few hated me, but that's because I was determined to be a cunt because I was afraid of being nice and normie" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"I've found people actually really respect niceness" ~ ConsciousCode
"In a bizarre way" ~ ConsciousCode
"Like, in algebra 2 some of my classmates were 2 years ahead of me" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I'd have this insane quirks like counting down to the bell to the second" ~ ConsciousCode
"And answered all the questions and generally was the teacher's pet" ~ ConsciousCode
"From what I remember, they first tried to make fun of me" ~ ConsciousCode
"But I was so lost in my own world and just being myself that they eventually stopped and seemed to treat me more like the class mascot" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah, I learnt later that niceness is not a normie quality per se." ~ EnKrypt-Work
"There's nothing wrong with being normie though" ~ ConsciousCode
"Being aggresive and "manly" never really made me go "wow, I want to be like that guy"" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"I mean to a certain extent no one's a normie because we all have our insanities" ~ ConsciousCode
"But if you do "normie" things, there's nothing wrong with that if that's how you roll" ~ ConsciousCode
"Our perceptions of normie might be pretty different." ~ EnKrypt-Work

"An INTP will unconsciously vet people for when they can and cannot be trusted with data. For example, they may have a good friend who always knows when someone is being fake, but can’t seem to wrap their head around time. When talking to them about motivations and intent the INTP knows they’re a trusted source of information, but they will dismiss that person whenever they talk about how long it will take to get somewhere." ~ EnKrypt-Work
"For an INTJ, there is no such thing as data separate from the person holding that data. That is to say, our perceptions will always color the information we carry and so data is never clean." ~ EnKrypt-Work
"No matter! It’s not the empirical nature of the data that’s important, it’s the result it produces that’s the important thing. Which is why INTJs unconsciously vet people for their usefulness, not the data they hold (unless that’s how the person is ‘useful’)." ~ EnKrypt-Work

"I'm calculating a thing from an idea JQ had" ~ ConsciousCode
"Basically, the rate of a population's uniform spread through space is necessarily limited by the speed of light" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I wanted to calculate the radius of an idealized civilization's spread across a uniform sphere such that to increase the volume of the sphere at a rate which supports the population, you'd need to travel faster than light" ~ ConsciousCode
"There's 2 parameters, energy per person and energy per volume" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I know a few relationships from this setup" ~ ConsciousCode
"V(t) = 4pi*r(t)^3/3, where r(t) is the radius function" ~ ConsciousCode
"E(t) = EpV * V(t)" ~ ConsciousCode
"And dE/dt(t) = EpP * P(t)" ~ ConsciousCode
"I'm pretty sure this isn't complete though, because when you play with it you find that P(t) has no definite solution" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which makes sense because these relationships can still hold even if P(t) = C" ~ ConsciousCode
"In which case the radius would be asymptotic" ~ ConsciousCode
"(oh uh, V(t) is volume, E(t) is the total energy consumed, and P(t) is the total population)" ~ ConsciousCode
"Nevermind actually, if P is constant, the radius increases roughly along the lines of cbrt(r)" ~ ConsciousCode
"dr/dt(t) = EpP/(EpV*4pi) * P(t)/r(t)^2" ~ ConsciousCode
"This is the best relationship I've derived thus far" ~ ConsciousCode

"The R, Z, and Y gates, for reset, update, and output" ~ ConsciousCode
"The reset gate said how much of the update gate was added to the state" ~ ConsciousCode
"And the output gate was, well" ~ ConsciousCode
"Not only that, but I was plagued with the inelegance of the design because R and Z had the same dimensionality" ~ ConsciousCode
"But no matter how I played the maths, they'd never combine" ~ ConsciousCode
"Earlier today I realized I was trying to combine the wrong things" ~ ConsciousCode
"And I should instead combine Z and Y" ~ ConsciousCode
"So the new-state and output are computed at the same time, then the new state is added back in through the reset gate" ~ ConsciousCode
"But while I was pondering more alien neural network architectures because I had this really bizarre sense that I Was on the verge of a breakthrough of simplicity" ~ ConsciousCode
"I realized that the reset gate doesn't have to JUST apply to the state" ~ ConsciousCode
"You can actually make it serve double duty via a single multiplication gate" ~ ConsciousCode
"And it doesn't need to add any (1 - x) terms because now the model is just one layer thick and has a trivial form modulated by multiplication" ~ ConsciousCode
"So now it looks like..." ~ ConsciousCode
"State and input get concat'd together" ~ ConsciousCode

"Famous problem that perceptrons failed at" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's a binary function that isn't linearly separable" ~ ConsciousCode
"Are you saying" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"That a combinations of perceptrons cannot be trained to compute XOR?" ~ EnKrypt-Work
"Perceptrons, as they were originally designed, could only classify linearly separable classes" ~ ConsciousCode
"Which is like," ~ ConsciousCode

"And you were supposed to draw a line that put class A on one side and class B on the other" ~ ConsciousCode
"With XOR, there is no such line" ~ ConsciousCode

"I added a plotting library to the mix" ~ ConsciousCode
"And it turns out it does eventually approximate it correctly" ~ ConsciousCode
"Although 2 memory slots isn't enough to totally cover it" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or at least, it had a bad local minima that wasn't the true minima" ~ ConsciousCode
"Interestingly, it seems to fall into the minima that have the same quirks" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's near perfect around the peaks and troughs (error ~= 0)" ~ ConsciousCode
"But when it gets to the zeros, the error spikes" ~ ConsciousCode

"Having to deal with contradicting demands would be really hard on me" ~ ConsciousCode
"Yeah but I wasn't anxious about it" ~ EnKrypt
"So why'd you do it? Out of frustration?" ~ ConsciousCode
"Also because I couldn't come up with something to write myself independant of what they both wanted" ~ EnKrypt

"Incidentally, 3/4 are women :P" ~ ConsciousCode
"First intuitively feels like a better match, but the second has a similar level of patient interaction and is a dual psychologist-psychiatrist" ~ ConsciousCode
"Re psychological issues" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's kind of weirding me out that randomly out of nowhere my projects are being brought closer to completion" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or in some cases, are actually partially completed" ~ ConsciousCode
"I've been on these meds before, but that was during the job" ~ ConsciousCode
"So I guess the meds weren't enough to work through the stress I had from the job" ~ ConsciousCode
"You've learnt enough to break the loop" ~ EnKrypt
"I chalk it up 99% to meds" ~ ConsciousCode

"And it just so happens that I fall out of alignment with this when I go off my meds" ~ ConsciousCode
"Or at the end of the day, when the shorter lasting of them wear off" ~ ConsciousCode
"It feels kind of dirty to say that though" ~ ConsciousCode
"Invalidating of my mental state, it's "only" chemical imbalances" ~ ConsciousCode

"Obviously it's a mix of both, somehow" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's never one or the other with stuff like this" ~ ConsciousCode
"Maybe I have a big mental scar that causes/IS the chemical imbalance, which meds paint over" ~ ConsciousCode
"If that's the case, it's absolutely essential that I be on these since they allow me to be functional before fixing some deep subconscious issues that no one else can see" ~ ConsciousCode
"It's important to have a holistic view of these things" ~ ConsciousCode
"Re: "it's only chemicals"" ~ ConsciousCode
"You aren't a puppet of those chemicals, as if you were some external entity separate from your body" ~ ConsciousCode

"You aren't a thing, you're a process of being" ~ ConsciousCode
"If that makes sense" ~ ConsciousCode
"You're a verb, not a noun" ~ ConsciousCode
"I still think you as a concept is not something that can have a same definition over time." ~ EnKrypt
